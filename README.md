## COMP0087 Project: Advancing Mathematical Reasoning in Small Language Models


This repository contains the code and example results for our project. This includes code for fine-tuning:

- T5-Small (60M)
- T5-Base (220M)
- Phi 1.5 (1.3B)


We also provide our LLM-generated (using quantized Gemma-7B) mathematical rationales within the data folder.
