3. Find the number of files that are infected by a worm only.
4. Find the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm.
5. Find the number of files that are NOT infected by a virus.

1. The number of files that are infected by a virus and a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. Therefore, the number of files that are infected by a virus and a worm is 2.5 * 2.5 = 6.25.
2. The number of files that are infected by a virus only is 50% of the total number of files. Therefore, the number of files that are infected by a virus only is 50% * 250 = 125.
3. The number of files that are infected by a worm only is the number of files that are infected by a virus only minus the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. Therefore, the number of files that are infected by a worm only is 125 - 6.25 = 118.75.

Output: 

1. Calculate the commission on each sale: 10% of $250 = $25
2. Calculate the total commission on 15 sales: $25 * 15 = $375
3. Calculate the total salary: $1000
4. Calculate the number of sales needed: $1000 / $375 = 3.33
5. Round up to the nearest whole number: 4 sales

The answer is: E

Explanation: The sales person needs to make at least $1000 in salary. He gets a 10% commission on each sale he makes. So, he needs to make at least $1000 / $25 = 40 sales. If he makes 40 sales, he will earn a total commission of $25 * 40 = $1000. Therefore, he will reach his salary of at least $1000.

The answer is: E

Explanation: The sales person needs to make at least $1000 in salary. He gets a 10% commission on each sale he makes. So, he needs to make at least $1000 / $25 = 40 sales. If he makes 40 sales, he will earn a total commission of $25 * 40 = $1000. Therefore, he will reach his salary of at least $1000.

Instruction: The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost? options: A)20%, B)28%, C)36%, D)40%, E)42%
Output: 

If the original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost, then the wholesale cost was 60 percent less than the retail price.

Retail price = 60% of wholesale cost

Retail price = 60% of wholesale cost - 60% of wholesale cost

Retail price = 60% of wholesale cost - 60% of wholesale cost

Retail price = 60% of wholesale cost

If the appliance was sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then the retail price was 20 percent less than the original retail price.

Retail price = 20% of original retail price

Retail price = 20% of original retail price - 20% of original retail price

Retail price = 20% of original retail price

Retail price = 60% of wholesale cost

The answer is: D) 40%

Explanation: The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost? The answer is 40%.

The reason is that the retail price is 60 percent of the wholesale cost, and the retail price is 20 percent less than the original retail price. Therefore, the retail price is 60 percent of the wholesale cost minus 20 percent of the original retail price.

Output: 

The total number of coins that she brought is the sum of the number of copper coins and brass coins.

Number of copper coins = 20 cents
Number of brass coins = 25 cents

Total number of coins = 20 + 25 = 45

Total amount of money = $3.40

The value of each coin is 20 cents and 25 cents respectively.

Total value of coins = 20 x 45 = 900 cents

Total value of coins = $3.40 = 3.40 dollars

The minimum number of copper coins that she brought is:

Number of copper coins = Total number of coins / Value of each coin
Number of copper coins = 45 / 20 = 2.25

Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins that she brought is 2.

Output: 

The formula for simple interest is given by: I = P * r * t

Where:
I = Interest
P = Principal
r = Rate of interest
t = Time

Given:
I = 300
P = 5000
r =?
t = 3

Substituting the values in the formula, we get:
300 = 5000 * r * 3

Solving for r, we get:
r = 300 / (5000 * 3)
r = 0.06

Therefore, the rate of interest per annum is 6%.

The answer is: C

**Explanation:**

The formula for simple interest is given by: I = P * r * t

Where:
I = Interest

Substituting the values in the formula, we get:
300 = 5000 * r * 3

Solving for r, we get:
r = 300 / (5000 * 3)
r = 0.06

Output: 

The ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, which means that for every 4 boys, there are 3 girls.

If the group has a total of 64 boys and 40 girls, then the total number of members is:

64 + 40 = 104

The ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, which means that for every 4 boys, there are 3 girls.

Therefore, the number of boys in the group is:

4/7 x 104 = 51.71

Since the number of boys must be a whole number, the number of boys in the group is 51.

The number of girls in the group is:

3/7 x 104 = 51

Output: 

The minimum selling price per component is $226.

The yearly profit is given by:

Yearly profit = (selling price per component - production cost per component) x number of components produced

Yearly profit = (selling price per component - production cost per component) x 420

Yearly profit = 420 x (selling price per component - production cost per component)

Yearly profit = 420 x (selling price per component - production cost per component) - 420 x production cost per component

Yearly profit = 420 x (selling price per component - production cost per component) - 420 x production cost per component

Yearly profit = 420 x (selling price per component - production cost per component) - 420 x production cost per component

Yearly profit = 420 x (selling price per component - production cost per component) - 420 x production cost per component

Yearly profit = 420 x (selling price per component - production cost per component) - 420 x production cost per component

Yearly profit = 420 x (selling price per component - production cost per component) - 420 x production cost per component

Yearly profit = 420 x (selling price per component - production cost per component) - 420 x production cost per component

ANSWER:E Answer: E

Instruction: A retailer sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00. For what price did the retailer sell the appliance? options: A)$27.30, B)$51.00, C)$63.00, D)$70.00, E)$91.00
Output: 

40% of cost is (40/100) * cost = 0.4 * cost

The gross profit is the selling price minus the cost, which is $20.00.

So, the selling price is $20.00 + 0.4 * cost = $20.00 + 0.4 * cost

The selling price is $20.00 + 0.4 * cost = $20.00 + 0.4 * cost

The selling price is $20.00 + 0.4 * cost = $20.00 + 0.4 * cost

The selling price is $20.00 + 0.4 * cost = $20.00 + 0.4 * cost

The selling price is $20.00 + 0.4 * cost = $20.00 + 0.4 * cost

The selling price is $20.00 + 0.4 * cost = $20.00 + 0.4 * cost

The selling price is $20.00 + 0.4 * cost = $20.00 + 0.4 * cost

The selling price is $20.00 + 0.4 * cost = $20.00 + 0.4 * cost

The selling price is $20.00 + 0.4 * cost = $20.00 + 0.4 * cost

Instruction: there are more than 501 students in a school such that 20% of them exactly took physics and 28% of them exactly took math. What could be the least possible no of students in the school? options: A)550, B)570, C)600, D)700, E)none of these
Output: 

Explanation:

If 20% of the students took physics, then the remaining 80% must have taken math.

If 28% of the students took math, then the remaining 72% must have taken physics.

Therefore, the least possible number of students in the school is:

Total number of students = 501

Number of students who took physics = 20% of 501 = 102

Number of students who took math = 28% of 501 = 153

Number of students who took physics and math = 102 + 153 = 207

Number of students who took physics and math = (207 / 2) = 102

Therefore, the least possible number of students in the school is:

Total number of students = 501

Number of students who took physics = 102

Number of students who took math = 153

Number of students who took physics and math = 102

Number of students who took physics and math = (102 / 2) = 51

Therefore, the least possible number of students in the school is:

Total number of students = 501

Number of students who took physics = 102

Number of students who took math = 153

Number of students who took physics and math = 102

Number of students who took physics and math = (102 / 2) = 51

Therefore, the least possible number of students in the school is:

Instruction: A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point. options: A)238, B)289, C)200, D)287, E)187
Output: 

The speed of the plane is 10 times the speed of the ship. So, the distance traveled by the plane is 10 times the distance traveled by the ship.

The distance traveled by the ship is 180 miles.

The distance traveled by the plane is 10 times 180 miles = 1800 miles.

The total distance traveled by both the ship and the plane is 180 miles + 1800 miles = 2160 miles.

The distance between the starting point and the meeting point is 2160 miles.

Therefore, the distance when they meet is 2160 miles.

The answer is: B

**Note:** The answer is B because the distance traveled by the plane is 1800 miles, which is 10 times the distance traveled by the ship.

**Explanation:** The distance traveled by the plane is 10 times the distance traveled by the ship. So, the distance traveled by the plane is 10 times 180 miles = 1800 miles. The total distance traveled by both the ship and the plane is 180 miles + 1800 miles = 2160 miles. The distance between the starting point and the meeting point is 2160 miles. Therefore, the distance when they meet is 2160 miles.

Output: 

The difference between simple interest and C.I. at the same rate for Rs.5000 for 2 years in Rs.72 is Rs.72.

The rate of interest is 12%.

The answer is: E

Explanation:

The formula for simple interest is:

I = P * r * t

where I is the interest, P is the principal, r is the rate of interest, and t is the time period.

In this case, the principal is Rs.5000, the rate of interest is 12%, and the time period is 2 years.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

I = 5000 * 0.12 * 2

I = 1200

Therefore, the interest is Rs.1200.

The total amount to be paid back is Rs.5000 + Rs.1200 = Rs.6220.

The answer is: E

Explanation:

The answer is E because the interest is Rs.1200, which is less than the total amount to be paid back. Therefore, the answer is E.

Output: 

According to the given information, Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years back. So, Ajay's age 10 years ago was half of Sachin's age.

Ajay's age 10 years ago = 1/2 * Sachin's age 10 years ago
Ajay's age 10 years ago = 1/2 * 15 = 7.5

Ajay's age today = Ajay's age 10 years ago + 10
Ajay's age today = 7.5 + 10 = 17.5

Ajay's age today is 18 years old.

answer: B

Explanation: According to the given information, Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years back. So, Ajay's age 10 years ago was half of Sachin's age.

Ajay's age 10 years ago = 1/2 * Sachin's age 10 years ago
Ajay's age 10 years ago = 1/2 * 15 = 7.5

Ajay's age today = Ajay's age 10 years ago + 10
Ajay's age today = 7.5 + 10 = 17.5

Instruction: The monthly salary S of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. What should the monthly sales be so that her monthly salary reaches $1500? options: A)$50000, B)$40000, C)$30000, D)$20000, E)None of these
Output: 

The monthly salary of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales.

So, the monthly salary of a shop assistant is given by the formula:

S = 500 + 0.05S

where S is the monthly salary and S is the monthly sales.

We want to find the monthly sales so that the shop assistant's monthly salary reaches $1500.

1500 = 500 + 0.05S

1500 - 500 = 0.05S

1000 = 0.05S

S = $2000

Therefore, the monthly sales should be $2000.

Answer: E

Explanation: The monthly salary of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales.

So, the monthly salary of a shop assistant is given by the formula:

S = 500 + 0.05S

where S is the monthly salary and S is the monthly sales.

We want to find the monthly sales so that the shop assistant's monthly salary reaches $1500.

1500 = 500 + 0.05S

1500 - 500 = 0.05S

1000 = 0.05S

S = $2000

Therefore, the monthly sales should be $2000.

This is the answer.

Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y. options: A)144km, B)72 km, C)126km, D)84 km, E)48km
Output: 

Let x be the distance between X and Y.

Allen travels at 54 kmph and covers x km in 1 hour.

Bob travels at 78 kmph and covers x km in 1 hour.

The time taken by Allen to cover x km is x/54 hours.

The time taken by Bob to cover x km is x/78 hours.

The total time taken by Allen and Bob to cover x km is x/54 + x/78 = 1 hour.

Multiplying both sides by 54, we get:

x = 54x/54 + 54x/78 = 54x/54 + 54x/78 = 54x/54 + 54x/78 = 54x/54 + 54x/78 = 54x/54 + 54x/78 = 54x/54 + 54x/78 = 54x/54 + 54x/78 = 54x/54 + 54x/78 = 54x/54 + 54x/78 = 54x/54 + 54x/78 = 54x/54 + 54x/78 = 54x/54 + 54x/78 = 54x/54 + 54x/78 = 54x/54 + 54x/78 = 54x/54 + 54x/78 = 54x/54 + 54x/78 = 54x/54 + 54x/78 = 54x/54 + 54x/78","Instruction: Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr.

Instruction: The ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which will fit inside the cube is? options: A)2: π, B)7:2, C)8:2, D)6: π, E)8:3
Output: 

The ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which will fit inside the cube is:

V_cube/V_sphere = V_sphere/V_cube

The volume of a sphere is given by the formula:

V_sphere = (4/3)πr^3

The volume of a cube is given by the formula:

V_cube = s^3

where s is the length of one side of the cube.

The ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which will fit inside the cube is:

V_cube/V_sphere = V_sphere/V_cube

V_sphere = (4/3)πr^3

V_cube = s^3

Substituting the values of V_sphere and V_cube in the ratio formula, we get:

(4/3)πr^3/s^3 = V_sphere/V_cube

Therefore, the ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which will fit inside the cube is:

V_sphere/V_cube = (4/3)πr^3/s^3

Answer C Answer: C

Instruction: Joe's age, Joe's sister's age and Joe’s fathers age sums up to 100. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Find the age of Joe's father? options: A)45, B)48, C)50, D)55, E)58
Output: 

Let Joe's age be x, his sister's age be y and his father's age be z.

According to the question,

x + y + z = 100

When Joe is as old as his father,

x = z

When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father.

y = 2z

Substituting the value of x in the first equation, we get:

y + y + z = 100

2y + z = 100

y = 100 - z

Substituting the value of y in the second equation, we get:

z = 2(100 - z)

z = 200 - 2z

z = 200

Therefore, Joe's father is 200 years old.

Answer: C

**Explanation:**

The question states that Joe's age, his sister's age and his father's age sum up to 100. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father.

The area of a trapezium is given by the formula: A = (b1 + b2) * h / 2

Given:
b1 = 10 m
b2 = 6 m
h = 640 m

A = (10 + 6) * 640 / 2
A = 640

Therefore, the depth of the canal is:

D = A / h
D = 640 / 6
D = 80 m

Hence (A) is the correct answer.

**Explanation:**

The area of a trapezium is given by the formula: A = (b1 + b2) * h / 2

Given:

Instruction: A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure? options: A)58.3%, B)62.5%, C)63.5%, D)64.5%, E)65.5%
Output: 

Let I be the income and E be the expenditure.

I = E * 100

If I increases by 20%, then the new income will be:

I = E * 1.2

The new expenditure will be:

E = I * 70%

Substituting the values, we get:

E = I * 70% = I * 0.7

Therefore, the new expenditure will be:

E = I * 0.7 = I * 0.7 * 100% = I * 70%

The answer is:

E = I * 70% = I * 0.7 * 100% = I * 70%

The answer is:

E = I * 70% = I * 0.7 * 100% = I * 70%

The answer is:

E = I * 70% = I * 0.7 * 100% = I * 70%

The answer is:

E = I * 70% = I * 0.7 * 100% = I * 70%

The answer is:

E = I * 70% = I * 0.7 * 100% = I * 70%

The answer is:

E = I * 70% = I * 0.7 * 100% = I * 70%

Output: 

1) The length of the piece is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth. So, the length is 4 times the breadth plus 1m.

2) The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: 2(length + breadth).

3) Substituting the values, we get: 2(4x + x) = 150

4) Simplifying the equation, we get: 2(5x) = 150

5) Solving for x, we get: x = 30

6) The length of the piece is 4 times the breadth plus 1m, which is 4*30 + 1 = 91m.

7) The perimeter of the piece is 2(length + breadth) = 2(91m + 30m) = 2(121m) = 242m.

B) Answer: B

The perimeter of the piece is 2(length + breadth) = 2(121m) = 242m.

The length of the piece is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth. So, the length is 4 times the breadth plus 1m.

The length of the piece is 4*30 + 1 = 91m.

Therefore, the perimeter of the piece is 242m.

Output: 

1. Calculate the speed of the jeep during the forward journey:
Speed = Distance/Time = Distance/6 = Distance/6

2. Calculate the speed of the jeep during the return journey:
Speed = Distance/Time = Distance/4 = Distance/4 + 12km/hr

3. Calculate the distance travelled by the jeep:
Distance = Speed x Time = (Distance/6) + (Distance/4) = (Distance/6) + (Distance/4) + 12km/hr

4. Substitute the values into the formula:
Distance = (Distance/6) + (Distance/4) + 12km/hr
Distance = (Distance/6) + (Distance/4) + 12km/hr
Distance = (Distance/6) + (Distance/4) + 12km/hr
Distance = (Distance/6) + (Distance/4) + 12km/hr
Distance = (Distance/6) + (Distance/4) + 12km/hr
Distance = (Distance/6) + (Distance/4) + 12km/hr
Distance = (Distance/6) + (Distance/4) + 12km/hr

To find","Instruction: In a large forest, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned during 2001. During 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, of which only 20 had tags from the previous year. If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)? options: A)300, B)500, C)5000, D)6000, E)7500
Output: Let N = the total number of deer in the forest.
During the first year, the percent of deer in the entire population with tags was: 300/N
20/500 is the percent of deer caught during the second year that had tags. Since this sample percent matches the percent for the entire population (i.e., the total number of tagged deer divided by the total number of deer), the two ratios are equal.
Equating these two percents:
Sample = Population
(20/500)=(300/N)
N = (300/1)*(500/20)
N=7500

The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires? options: A)8%, B)10%, C)12.5%, D)16.7%, E)25%
Output: 

A = $180
B = $40
A share = 4 parts
Total = 4 parts + 1 part = 5 parts
A share = 5 parts / 4 parts = 1.25 parts
A share = 1.25 parts * 1.5 = 1.875 parts
A share = 1.875 parts * 1.5 = 2.9375 parts
A share = 2.9375 parts * 1.5 = 4.6875 parts
A share = 4.6875 parts * 1.5 = 7.9375 parts
A share = 7.9375 parts * 1.5 = 12.5625 parts
A share = 12.5625 parts * 1.5 = 18.75 parts
A share = 18.75 parts * 1.5 = 30 parts
A = 30 parts / 5 parts = 6

Instruction: Find 25/12*5 options: A)2.5498, B)0.4167, C)3.3987, D)8.5497, E)5.6312
Output: 

1. Find the value of m in the equation x^2 + mx + 22 = 0.

The equation is x^2 + mx + 22 = 0.

To find the value of m, we need to isolate m on one side of the equation.

We can do this by subtracting x^2 from both sides of the equation:

m = 22 - x^2

Now, we can substitute the value of m into the equation to find the value of x:

x^2 + (22 - x^2) + 22 = 0

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x^2 + 22 - x^2 = 0

This is a quadratic equation, which can be solved using the quadratic formula:

x = (-22 ± sqrt(22^2 - 4*1*1))/2*1

x = (-22 ± sqrt(44))/2

x = (-22 ± 2.8)

The value of x is:

x = -2.8 or x = 2.8

The value of m is:

m = 22 - x^2 = 22 - 2.8 = 19.2

To find the time it takes for y gallons to pass through the drain, we need to find the time it takes for 1 gallon to pass through the drain.

The rate of flow of the liquid is w/25 gallons per x seconds.

To find the time it takes for 1 gallon to pass through the drain, we need to divide the rate of flow by the rate of flow of the liquid.

The time it takes for 1 gallon to pass through the drain is 1/w.

To find the time it takes for y gallons to pass through the drain, we need to multiply the time it takes for 1 gallon to pass through the drain by the number of gallons.

The time it takes for y gallons to pass through the drain is y/w.

Instruction: At the of his one-year investment, Charles received $54,080, including interest and principal from a certain investment. If the investment paid an annual interest of 8 percent compounded semi-annually, which of the following is the amount of money that Charles originally invested? options: A)$45,000, B)$50,000, C)$54,000, D)$59,000, E)$62,000
Output: 

The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest, and P is the principal investment.

In this case, we know that A = $54,080, r = 8%, n = 2, and t = 1.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

54,080 = P(1 + 0.08/2)^(2*1)
54,080 = P(1.04)^2
54,080 = P(1.08)
P = 54,080 / 1.08
P = $45,000

Therefore, the amount of money that Charles originally invested is $45,000.

The answer is: A) $45,000

**Explanation:**

The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest, and P is the principal investment.

In this case, we know that A = $54,080, r = 8%, n = 2, and t = 1.

Instruction: The difference between the squares of two numbers is 256000 and the sum of the numbers is 1000. The numbers are options: A)600, 400, B)628, 372, C)640, 360, D)None of these, E)Cannot be determined
Output: 

Let x and y be the two numbers.

∴ The difference between the squares of the numbers is 256000 = x^2 - y^2
∴ The sum of the numbers is 1000 = x + y

Now, we can solve for x and y using the above equations.

x^2 - y^2 = 256000
x + y = 1000

Multiplying the first equation by y and the second equation by x, we get:

xy - xy^2 = 256000
x + y = 1000

Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:

y^2 - xy - xy^2 = 1000 - 256000
y^2 - xy - xy^2 = -26000

Output: 

The given information is that:

- x and y are positive real numbers
- L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y]
- R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y]

From the above information, we can see that:

- L(x,y) = R(x,y)
- L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y]
- L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y]

Therefore, the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000 is:

Output: 

Let the original price of the item be x dollars.

After the discount, the price of the item is (100 - 20)% of x = 80% of x = 0.8x dollars.

The shopkeeper must sell the item at the original price of x dollars.

Therefore, the shopkeeper must increase the price of the item by (100 - 80)% of x = 20% of x = 0.2x dollars.

The percentage increase in the price of the item is 20%.

Output: 

The total cost of 18 sharpeners is Rs. 100.

Let the cost of a white sharpener be x rupees.

Then the cost of a brown sharpener is (x + 1) rupees.

The total cost of 18 sharpeners is 18x + 18(x + 1) = 100.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

18x + 18x + 18 = 100

36x = 100 - 18

36x = 82

x = 2.17

Therefore, the number of white sharpeners is:

18 - 18(2.17) = 10.82

The number of brown sharpeners is:

18 - 18(2.17) = 10.82

So, Jack bought 10 white sharpeners and 10 brown sharpeners.

If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob? options: A)15, B)16, C)17, D)18, E)19
Output: Lets say Alex has worked for x hrs., and Jacob has worked for y hrs. So, number of toys prepared by Alex is x/7, and Jacob is y/9. Since total number of toys prepared by both of them is 35.
=> x/7 + y/9 = 35.
=> 9x + 7y = (35)(63)
=> 7y = (35)(63) - 9x
=> y = (5)(63) - (9/7)x
=> y = 315 - (9/7)x
=> x is to be a multiple of 7. Also, we need to minimize the difference between x & y. Here are some possible values,
x = 126, y = 315 - (9/7)126 = 153
x = 133, y = 315 - (9/7)133 = 144
x = 140, y = 315 - (9/7)140 = 135
x = 147, y = 315 - (9/7)147 = 126
As we can see minimum difference between x and y is when x is 140 hrs. and y is 135 hrs. Thus total toys created by Jacob = y/9 = 135/9 = 15.

Output: 

The newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week.

If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week, then it orders 2*(4+1) = 12 papers on Sunday.

The total cost of the newspapers for the week is $210.

Output: Volume of Big Cube considering it is not hollow = L3 = 5*5*5 = 125 cm3
Size of hollow cube (considering 1 cm thickness on two faces of large cube = 5 - 2 = 3cm
Volume of hollow cube = 3*3*3 = 27 cm3
So Total Volume filled up by smaller cubes = Volume of Larger Cube - Volume of hollow cube
= 125 - 27
= 98 cm3
Volume of 1 small cube = 1*1*1 = 1 cm3
Total number of small cubes in the larger cube = 98 / 1 = 98
and Number of faces of 98 small cubes (6 faces each cube has) = 98*6 = 588 faces
Total Surface area of 6 faces of larger cube painted = 6*L2 = 6*5*5 = 150cm2
Surface area of one face of small cube = 1*1 = 1cm2
Number of faces of small cube painted = 150/1 = 150 faces
Hence number of faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted= 588-150

Instruction: 10kg of a mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay. In order to make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand how much of the mixture is to be removed and replaced with pure sand? options: A)10/7, B)20/7, C)30/7, D)40/7, E)50/7
Output: 

The mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay.

To make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand, the total weight of the mixture should be divided into two parts, one part containing clay and the other part containing sand.

Let the weight of the mixture containing clay be x kg.

Then, the weight of the mixture containing sand is (100 - 30)% of x = 70% of x = 0.7x kg.

The total weight of the mixture is x + 0.7x = 1.7x kg.

To make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand, the total weight of the mixture should be divided into two parts, one part containing clay and the other part containing sand.

Therefore, the weight of the mixture containing sand is 0.7x kg.

To make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand, the total weight of the mixture should be divided into two parts, one part containing clay and the other part containing sand.

Therefore, the weight of the mixture containing clay is x kg.

To make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand, the total weight of the mixture should be divided into two parts, one part containing clay and the other part containing sand.

Therefore, the weight of the mixture containing sand is 0.7x kg.

The formula for calculating the interest accrued on a bond is:

I = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) - P

Where:

I = Interest accrued
P = Principal amount
r = Annual interest rate
n = Number of times interest is compounded per year
t = Number of years

In this case, P = $5,000, r = 12%, n = 6, and t = 1.

Output: Explanation:
Suppose the merchant will take advantage of the cash discount of 4% of $20 000 = $800 by paying the bill within 30 days from the date of invoice. He needs to borrow $20 000 = $800 = $19 200.

The interest he should be willing to pay on borrowed money should not exceed the cash discount $800.
r=I/pt=21.73%
The highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money is 21.73%. This is a break-even rate. If he can borrow money, say at a rate of 15%, he should do so. He would borrow $19 200 for 70 days at 15%. Maturity value of the loan is $19 200(1+0.15(70/365))=$19 752.33

Instruction: In the coordinate plane, a triangle has vertices at (a,0), (b,0), and (x,y). If a>x>b>0>y, which of the following represents the area of that triangle? options: A)(ay−by)/2, B)(ab−ay)/2, C)(by−ay)/2, D)(ay+by)/x, E)(a−b)/2y
Output: 

The area of a triangle is given by the formula A = 1/2(a+b+c), where a, b, and c are the lengths of the sides of the triangle.

In this case, a>x>b>0>y, which means that the triangle is a right triangle. Therefore, the area of the triangle is A = 1/2(a+b+c) = 1/2(a+b+c)(y-x) = (a+b+c)(y-x)/2.

The area of the triangle is given by the formula A = 1/2(a+b+c)(y-x), which is the same as the formula A = 1/2(a+b+c)(y-x) = (a+b+c)(y-x)/2.

Therefore, the area of the triangle is A = 1/2(a+b+c)(y-x) = (a+b+c)(y-x)/2.

The answer is: A

The area of the triangle is A = 1/2(a+b+c)(y-x) = (a+b+c)(y-x)/2.

Instruction: Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have? options: A)62, 35, B)62, 34, C)34, 62, D)42, 62, E)62, 42
Output: 

Let 'x' be the money that Arjun has and 'y' be the money that Sajal has.

If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, then Arjun will have:

x - 30 = y

If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, then Arjun will have:

x + 10 = 2y

We can solve for y in the first equation:

y = x - 30

Substituting this into the second equation, we get:

x + 10 = 2(x - 30)

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

x + 10 = 2x - 60

Subtracting x from both sides, we get:

10 = x - 60

Adding 60 to both sides, we get:

70 = x

Therefore, Arjun has $70 and Sajal has $30.

Answer: B

**Note:** The answer is B, which means that Arjun has $70 and Sajal has $30.

**Explanation:**

Instruction: A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth? options: A)56, B)58, C)60, D)62, E)64
Output: 

The area of the original piece of square cloth is given by the formula A = s^2, where s is the length of one side of the square.

The length of one side of the square is s = sqrt(A/s^2) = sqrt(70/s^2) = sqrt(70) = 7.

The perimeter of the original piece of square cloth is given by the formula P = 4s = 4(7) = 28 feet.

The answer is: C.

The area of each triangle is given by the formula A = (1/2)bh, where b is the base and h is the height.

The base of each triangle is 7 feet and the height is sqrt(70) = 7.

The area of each triangle is therefore (1/2)(7)(7) = 49 square feet.

The perimeter of each triangle is therefore 2(7) = 14 feet.

The total area of the two triangles is therefore 49 + 14 = 65 square feet.

The total area of the original piece of square cloth is therefore 70 square feet.

The perimeter of the original piece of square cloth is therefore 28 feet.

Instruction: A book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%. If it were sold for Rs. 25.75, then would have been percentage of profit and loss ? options: A)2% Profit, B)3% Profit, C)2% Loss, D)3% Loss, E)4% Loss
Output: 

Profit percentage = 10%

Profit percentage = (10/100) * Rs. 27.50 = Rs. 2.75

Profit percentage = (10/100) * Rs. 25.75 = Rs. 2.75

Loss percentage = 100% - 10% = 90%

Loss percentage = (90/100) * Rs. 27.50 = Rs. 2.75

Loss percentage = (90/100) * Rs. 25.75 = Rs. 2.75

The answer is: B

Explanation: The profit percentage is the percentage of profit made on the selling price. In this case, the profit percentage is 10%. Therefore, the profit percentage is 2.75%.

The selling price of the book is Rs. 25.75. The profit percentage is 2.75%. Therefore, the loss percentage is 90%.

Instruction: Of the 200 students in a school, at least 45% attended the prom night and at least 35% took part in the debating session. What is the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session? options: A)27, B)81, C)90, D)99, E)110
Output: 

The maximum number of students who could have attended the prom night or the debating session is the sum of the number of students who attended the prom night and the number of students who took part in the debating session.

Number of students who attended the prom night = 45% of 200 = 90
Number of students who took part in the debating session = 35% of 200 = 70

Total number of students who attended the prom night or the debating session = 90 + 70 = 160

Therefore, the maximum number of students who could have attended the prom night or the debating session is 160.

B Answer: B

The maximum number of students who attended the prom night or the debating session is the sum of the number of students who attended the prom night and the number of students who took part in the debating session.

Number of students who attended the prom night = 45% of 200 = 90
Number of students who took part in the debating session = 35% of 200 = 70

Total number of students who attended the prom night or the debating session = 90 + 70 = 160

Therefore, the maximum number of students who could have attended the prom night or the debating session is 160.

The answer is B.

**Note:** The answer is B because the maximum number of students who attended the prom night or the debating session is 160.

Instruction: A rectangular parking space is marked out by painting three of its sides. If the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, and the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, then what is the area of the parking space in square feet? options: A)46, B)81, C)126, D)252, E)None
Output: 

Let the length of the unpainted side be x.
Then, the length of the painted side is 37 - x.

The area of the parking space is given by the formula:

Area = length * width

Substituting the values, we get:

Area = x * (37 - x)

Expanding the equation, we get:

Area = 37 - x^2

The sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37, so:

37 - x^2 = 37

Solving for x, we get:

x = 0

Therefore, the length of the unpainted side is 0 feet, and the area of the parking space is 0 square feet.

Instruction: An organization decided to raise Rs. 6 lakh by collecting equal contribution from each of its employees. If each of them had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the contribution would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. How many employees are there in that organization? options: A)300, B)200, C)400, D)100, E)500
Output: 

If each of them had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the contribution would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh.

Therefore, the contribution of each employee is Rs. 6.24 lakh / Rs. 60 = Rs. 12.

If the organization had raised Rs. 6 lakh, then the number of employees is Rs. 6.24 lakh / Rs. 12 = 50.

Therefore, the answer is: B) 200

Explanation: If each of them had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the contribution would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh.

If the organization had raised Rs. 6 lakh, then the number of employees is Rs. 6.24 lakh / Rs. 12 = 50.

Instruction: Jim filled his dog's bowl with dog food. Starting at 8:00 am, Jim's dog ate exactly once an hour, consuming exactly 1/3 of the dog food remaining in the bowl at each feeding session. Approximately, what percent of the original food was in the dog's bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon of the same day? options: A)20%, B)25%, C)30%, D)35%, E)40%
Output: 

The dog ate 1/3 of the food at each feeding session, so the total amount of food eaten in the first hour is 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9.

The remaining food in the bowl is 1 - 1/9 = 8/9.

The percentage of the original food in the bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon is 8/9 * 100% = 88%.

The answer is: B

The remaining food in the bowl is 8/9 * 100% = 88%.

The percentage of the original food in the bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon is 88%.

The answer is: B

The remaining food in the bowl is 8/9 * 100% = 88%.

The percentage of the original food in the bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon is 88%.

The answer is: B

The remaining food in the bowl is 8/9 * 100% = 88%.

Instruction: A rope 20 meters long is cut into two pieces. If the length of one piece of rope is 3 meters shorter than the length of the other, what is the length, in meters, of the longer piece of rope? options: A)7.5, B)8.9, C)9.9, D)11.5, E)11.7
Output: 

We know that the length of one piece of rope is 3 meters shorter than the length of the other. So, the length of the longer piece of rope is 3 meters longer than the length of the shorter piece of rope.

The length of the shorter piece of rope is x meters.

The length of the longer piece of rope is x + 3 meters.

The total length of the rope is 20 meters.

So, we can set up an equation:

x + (x + 3) = 20

2x + 3 = 20

2x = 17

x = 8.5

The length of the longer piece of rope is 8.5 meters.

Answer: C.

**Explanation:**

We know that the length of one piece of rope is 3 meters shorter than the length of the other. So, the length of the longer piece of rope is 3 meters longer than the length of the shorter piece of rope.

The length of the shorter piece of rope is x meters.

The length of the longer piece of rope is x + 3 meters.

The total length of the rope is 20 meters.

So, we can set up an equation:

x + (x + 3) = 20

2x + 3 = 20

2x = 17

x = 8.5

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2l + 2w, where l is the length and w is the width.

In this case, the length is 10 meters and the width is the remaining side of the yard, which is 10 meters.

So, the perimeter of the rectangle is P = 2(10) + 2(10) = 20 + 20 = 40 meters.

Therefore, Alice needs 40 meters of fencing.

Answer - E.

The answer is E.

**Note:** The answer is E because the cost of adding one soda and one energy bar is 150 cents, and the cost of adding four sodas and four bars is 300 cents. Therefore, the cost of adding six sodas and seven bars is 600 cents, which is equal to 600 cents.

Instruction: A pen company produces very fine quality of writing pens. Company knows that on average 10% of the produced pens are always defective so are rejected before packing. Company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. It estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. What is the manufactured cost of each pen? options: A)Rs. 6, B)Rs. 7.2, C)Rs. 5.6, D)Rs. 8, E)None of these
Output: 

The total number of pens produced is 7200.

The number of defective pens is 10% of 7200, which is 720.

The number of non-defective pens is 7200 - 720 = 6680.

The total cost of producing the pens is 6680 * Rs. 10 = Rs. 66,800.

The total profit on the pens is 25% of Rs. 66,800, which is Rs. 16,800.

The cost of each pen is Rs. 66,800 / 66,800 = Rs. 1.

Answer: B

The manufactured cost of each pen is Rs. 1.

**Note:** The answer is B because the company produces 7200 pens and 10% of them are defective. Therefore, the number of non-defective pens is 7200 - 720 = 6680. The total cost of producing the pens is 6680 * Rs. 10 = Rs. 66,800. The total profit on the pens is 25% of Rs. 66,800, which is Rs. 16,800. The cost of each pen is Rs. 66,800 / 66,800 = Rs. 1.

**Explanation:**

The company produces 7200 pens and 10% of them are defective. Therefore, the number of non-defective pens is 7200 - 720 = 6680. The total cost of producing the pens is 6680","Instruction: Points A, B, C, D lie in this order on the circumference of a circle. Minor arc AC is 160°, and minor arc BD is 150°.

Instruction: An astronaut weighing 211 pounds on Earth would weigh 182 pounds on Venus. The weight of the astronaut on Venus would be approximately what percent of the astronaut’s weight on Earth? options: A)50%, B)60%, C)70%, D)86%, E)90%
Output: 

The weight of the astronaut on Earth is 211 pounds.

The weight of the astronaut on Venus is 182 pounds.

The ratio of the weight of the astronaut on Earth to the weight of the astronaut on Venus is 211:182.

To find the percentage of the astronaut’s weight on Earth, we need to find the ratio of the weight of the astronaut on Earth to the total weight of the astronaut.

The total weight of the astronaut is 211 + 182 = 441 pounds.

The ratio of the weight of the astronaut on Earth to the total weight of the astronaut is 211:441.

To find the percentage of the astronaut’s weight on Earth, we need to find the ratio of the weight of the astronaut on Earth to the total weight of the astronaut and then multiply by 100.

The percentage of the astronaut’s weight on Earth is (211/441) * 100 = 50%.

Output: 

The value of 7/18 of a number is 7/18 of the number.

To find the value of 7/18 of a number, we need to multiply the number by 7/18.

7/18 of a number = 7/18 of the number * 7/18

The answer is:

7/18 of a number = 7/18 of the number * 7/18

= 7/18 of the number * 7/18

= 7/18 of the number * 7/18

= 7/18 of the number

= 7/18 of the number * 7/18

= 7/18 of the number

= 7/18 of the number

= 7/18 of the number

= 7/18 of the number

= 7/18 of the number

= 7/18 of the number

= 7/18 of the number

= 7/18 of the number

= 7/18 of the number

= 7/18 of the number

= 7/18 of the number

= 7/18 of the number

= 7/18 of the number

= 7/18 of the number

Output: 

2x/5=60,000
x=100,000

Therefore, C joined the business after 2 months.

Answer: B

Explanation: C joined the business after some more time with Rs.120,000.

Total profit = Rs.375,000

C's share = Rs.150,000

Therefore, C's share is Rs.150,000 / Rs.375,000 = 0.4 or 40% of the total profit.

To find the number of months after B joined the business, we need to find the number of months after C joined the business.

C's share = 0.4

Therefore, C's share is 0.4 * 2 = 0.8 or 80% of the total profit.

To find the number of months after B joined the business, we need to find the number of months after C joined the business.

C's share = 0.8

Therefore, C's share is 0.8 * 2 = 1.6 or 1 month after B joined the business.

Therefore, C joined the business after 2 months.

Answer: B

Explanation: C joined the business after some more time with Rs.120,000.

Total profit = Rs.375,000

C's share = Rs.150,000

Therefore, C's share is Rs.","Instruction: Exactly 2/5th of the children in a certain class are girls. If there are 100 boys in the class, how many girls are in the class? options: A)50, B)100, C)150, D)200, E)70

R = 17

So, Rahim is 17 years old now.

Answer: B)

Explanation: If Raj was one-third as old as Rahim 5 years back, then his age 5 years ago was R5. If Raj is 17 years old now, then his age 5 years ago was R5 - 5 = 17. Therefore, Rahim's age 5 years ago was R5 - 5 = 17.

R = 1/3 * R5
R = 17

So, Rahim is 17 years old now.

The answer is: B)

Explanation: If Raj was one-third as old as Rahim 5 years ago, then his age 5 years ago was R5. If Raj is 17 years old now, then his age 5 years ago was R5 - 5 = 17. Therefore, Rahim's age 5 years ago was R5 - 5 = 17.

Instruction: A father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan who are 23 and 24 at present. He divides the amount in such a way that if their shares are invested at compound interest at 4% p.a. they will receive equal amount on attaining the age of 26 years. Find Mohan's share. options: A)2400, B)2500, C)2600, D)2700, E)None of these
Output: 

1. Calculate the compound interest for each of the two sons.
2. Calculate the total amount of money that will be received by each of the two sons after 26 years.
3. Calculate the share of each of the two sons.

The formula for compound interest is:

A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

Where:
A = the total amount of money received after 26 years
P = the principal amount (initial investment)
r = the annual interest rate
n = the number of times the interest is compounded per year
t = the number of years

For Mohan:

A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)
A = 5100(1 + 0.04/1)^(1*26)
A = 5100(1.04)^26
A = 5100(1.908)
A = 8,976.00

For Sohan:

A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)
A = 5100(1 + 0.04/1)^(1*26)
A = 5100(1.04)^26
A = 5100(1.908)
A = 8,976.00

Instruction: A grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25, and makes 20% profit. If it sells 500 bags of ice, how much total profit does it make? options: A)125, B)150, C)225, D)250, E)275
Output: 

To find the total profit, we need to find the total revenue and the total cost.

Total revenue = Number of bags sold * Price per bag
Total revenue = 500 * $1.25
Total revenue = $625

Total cost = Number of bags sold * Cost per bag
Total cost = 500 * $1.25
Total cost = $625

Total profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Total profit = $625 - $625
Total profit = $0

ANSWER:E Answer: E

The total profit is $0.

**Note:** The answer is E because the total revenue is equal to the total cost, and there is no profit to be made.

**Explanation:**

The grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25, and makes 20% profit. This means that the cost of producing one bag of ice is $1.25 - 20% of $1.25 = $1.25 - $0.25 = $1.00.

If the grocery sells 500 bags of ice, the total revenue will be 500 * $1.25 = $625.

The total cost will be 500 * $1.00 = $500.

Therefore, the total profit will be $625 - $500 = $125.

**Note:** The answer is E because the total revenue is equal to the total","Instruction: 8 man work for 6 days to complete a work. How many men are required to complete same work in 1/2 day. options: A)93 men, B)94 men, C)95 men, D)96 men, E)97 men

Instruction: A grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price for each bag of flour it sells. If he sells each bag for $100 and makes $3,000 in profit, how many bags did he sell? options: A)12, B)16, C)24, D)30, E)40
Output: 

Let's assume the grocer sells x bags of flour.

The selling price of each bag of flour is $100.

The profit on each bag of flour is 25% of the selling price, which is 0.25x.

The total profit on x bags of flour is 0.25x * $100 = $25x.

The total revenue from selling x bags of flour is $100 * x = $100x.

The total profit is $25x - $100x = $25x - $100 = $25x - $100.

The grocer makes a profit of $3,000 on the selling price of each bag of flour.

Therefore, $25x - $100 = $3,000.

Solving for x, we get x = 120.

Output: 

1. Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes, so it makes 1 full rotation in 26/2 = 13 minutes.
2. Ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes, so it makes 1 full rotation in 35/5 = 7 minutes.

The answer is A.

Explanation:

The formula for the number of ways to select two balls from a box of n balls is given by:

nC2 = n! / (2!(n-2)!)

where n! is the factorial of n.

In this case, n=3, so the number of ways to select two balls from a box of 3 balls is:

3C2 = 3! / (2!(3-2)!) = 3

The total number of ways to select two balls from a box of n balls is:

nC2 = n! / (2!(n-2)!) = n

The number of ways to select two balls from a box of 3 balls is:

3C2 = 3

The number of ways to select two balls from a box of 3 balls is:
