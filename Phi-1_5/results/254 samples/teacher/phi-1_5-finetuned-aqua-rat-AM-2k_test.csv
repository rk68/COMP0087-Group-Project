What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ? options: A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280
Output: 
Let's assume that the minimum selling price per component is x.
The total revenue from selling 420 units of the component is 420x.
The total production cost is 110x.
The yearly profit is (420x - 110x) = 280x.
We want the yearly profit to be at least $626,400, so we can write the equation 280x ≥ 626,400.
Solving for x, we get x ≥ $26,400/280 = $130.
Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit will be at least $626,400 is $130.
Answer: C.
Explanation:
Minimum selling price per component = $130
Total revenue from selling 420 units of the component = 420x
Total production cost = 110x
Yearly profit = 280x
Minimum yearly profit = $626,400
$626,400 ≥ 280x + 110x
$626,400 ≥ 390x
x ≥ $26,400/390 = $130
Answer: C.
Explanation:
Minimum selling price per component = $130
Total revenue from selling 420 units of the component = 420x

How much does each daughter receive ? options: A)Rs 400, B)Rs 500, C)Rs 600, D)Rs 700, E)Rs 800
Output: 
Let the amount of money each nephew receives be x.
Then, the amount of money each nephew receives is 4x.
Let the amount of money each daughter receives be y.
Then, the amount of money each daughter receives is 4y.
Let the amount of money each son receives be z.
Then, the amount of money each son receives is 5z.
The total amount of money is Rs 8600.
So, x + 4x + 4y + 5z + 5z = Rs 8600

Let the number of passing students be x and the number of failing students be y.
Then, x + y = n
x + (n-y) = (n*76)/83
x + n - y = (n*76)/83

If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth? options: A)56, B)58, C)60, D)62, E)64
Output: 
Let the side of the square be x.
Then, the side of the rectangle is (x-4).
The area of the rectangle is (x-4)(x+4) = x^2 + 4x - 16.
The area of each triangle is (1/2)(x^2 + 4x - 16) = (x^2 + 4x - 16)/2.
Given that the area of each triangle is 70 square feet, we have (x^2 + 4x - 16)/2 = 70.
Solving for x, we get x = 10.
The perimeter of the original piece of square cloth is 4x + 4 = 4(10) + 4 = 44 feet.
