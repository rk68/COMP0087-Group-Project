"You can purchase one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents, or two sodas and three energy bars for 300
cents. If the costs of the items do not change, compute the cost in cents of six sodas and seven bars.","['A)500', 'B)600', 'C)750', 'D)800', 'E)900']",E,"Instruction: You can purchase one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents, or two sodas and three energy bars for 300
cents. If the costs of the items do not change, compute the cost in cents of six sodas and seven bars. options: A)500, B)600, C)750, D)800, E)900
Output: 
Let the cost of one soda be x cents and the cost of one energy bar be y cents.
Then, we have the following equations:
x + 2y = 150
2x + 3y = 300
Solving these equations, we get x = 50 cents and y = 25 cents.
So, the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars is 6(50) + 7(25) = 500 cents.
Answer: A)500
Explanation: Cost of one soda = 50 cents, cost of one energy bar = 25 cents.
Cost of six sodas and seven energy bars = 6(50) + 7(25) = 500 cents.

Output: 
Let the number of files infected by a virus be x.
Then the number of files infected by a worm is 2.5x.
The total number of files infected by both a virus and a worm is x + 2.5x = 3.5x.
50% of the files were not infected by a virus, so the number of files infected by a virus is 0.5x.
The number of files infected by a worm is 3.5x - 0.5x = 2.5x.
The number of files infected by both a virus and a worm is 3.5x - 0.5x = 2x.
The number of files infected by both a virus and a worm is 2.5x - 2x = 0.5x.
The number of files infected by both a virus and a worm is 2.5x - 0.5x = 2x.

Output: 
Let's assume that the minimum selling price per component is x.
The total revenue from selling 420 units of the component is 420x.
The total production cost is 110x.
The minimum profit is (420x - 110x) = 290x.
The minimum selling price per component is x = 290/420 = 0.57.
Answer: A) 226
Explanation: The minimum selling price per component is $0.57.
The total revenue from selling 420 units of the component is 420 * 0.57 = $226.
The total production cost is 110 * 0.57 = $59.70.
The minimum profit is (420 * 0.57 - 110 * 0.57) = $290.
Answer: A)

How much does each daughter receive ? options: A)Rs 400, B)Rs 500, C)Rs 600, D)Rs 700, E)Rs 800
Output: 
Let the amount received by each nephew be x.
Then, the amount received by each daughter is 4x.
And, the amount received by each son is 5x.

Total amount received by all nephews = 4x + 4x + 5x = 9x
Total amount received by all daughters = 4x + 4x = 8x
Total amount received by all sons = 5x = 5x
Total amount received by all nephews and all daughters = 9x + 8x + 5x = 17x
Total amount received by all nephews and all daughters = 8x = 8x
Total amount received by all nephews and all daughters = 17x = 17x
Total amount received by all nephews and all daughters = 17x = 17x

What is the speed of the elevator? options: A)1 step/minute, B)2 step/minute, C)3 step/minute, D)4 step/minute, E)None of the above
Output: 
Let's assume the speed of the elevator is x steps/min.
Then, the time taken to walk 20 steps = 20/x
Time taken to walk 10 steps = 10/x
10/x = 20/x
10x = 20x
x = 0
So, the speed of the elevator is 0 steps/min.

Output: 
2/3 of the number = (2/3)x
10 = (2/3)x - (2/3)x + (2/3)x
10 = (2/3)x + (2/3)x - (2/3)x

of 55. If the overall class average was 76, what percent of the class passed? options: A)44%, B)66%, C)68%, D)72%, E)75%
Output: 
Let the number of passing students be x and the number of failing students be y.
Then, x + y = n and 83x + 55y = 76n
Solving for x and y, we get x = (n - y)/2 and y = n - x/2
Substituting x and y in the equation 83x + 55y = 76n, we get
(n - y)/2 + (n - x/2)/2 = 76
Multiplying both sides by 2, we get
n - y + x - x/2 = 152
Solving for x and y, we get x = (n - y)/2 and y = n - x/2
Substituting x and y in the equation 83x + 55y = 76n, we get
(n - y)/2 + (n - x/2)/2 = 76
Multiplying both sides by 2, we get
n - y + x - x/2 = 152
Solving for x and y, we get x = (n - y)/2 and y = n - x/2

Output: 
Let the time taken by both machines to produce 10 yo-yos be x minutes.
Then,
Machine A will have produced 10/6 = 1.67 yo-yos in x minutes.
Machine B will have produced 10/9 = 1.11 yo-yos in x minutes.
So,
1.67 + 1.11 = 2.78 = 2.78x
x = 2.78x/2.78 = x = 1.11
Answer: C
Output: 1.11x = 1.11x/1.11 = 1.11
Answer: C
Output: 1.11x = 1.11x/1.11 = 1.11
Answer: C
Output: 1.11x = 1.11x/1.11 = 1.11
Answer: C
Output: 1.11x = 1.11x/1.11 = 1.11

Find the area of the sheet.,"['A)1584', 'B)1120', 'C)792', 'D)1320', 'E)1200']",B,"Instruction: When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Find the area of the sheet. options: A)1584, B)1120, C)792, D)1320, E)1200
Output: 
Let the length of the sheet be x.
Then, the width of the sheet is (x/2).
Perimeter of the sheet = 2(x + x/2) = 2(x + x/2) = 4x/2 = 2x
Perimeter of the sheet folded along one set of sides = 2x
Perimeter of the sheet folded along the other set of sides = 66
2x = 2x + 66
x = 66
Area of the sheet = (x/2) x (x/2) = x^2
Area of the sheet = x^2 = 66^2 = 466

Output: 
Let the number of white sharpeners be x and the number of brown sharpeners be y.
Then, the total cost of the sharpeners is 100.
x + y = 18
x = y + 1
Substituting the value of x in the first equation, we get
y + 1 + y = 18
2y + 1 = 18
2y = 17
y = 8.5
Since the number of sharpeners must be a whole number, we can't have 8.5 brown sharpeners.

The area of the triangle is (1/2)(x - 4)(x - 4) = x^2 - 16.
Given that the area of each triangle is 70 square feet, we have x^2 - 16 = 70.
Solving for x, we get x = 28.
The perimeter of the original piece of square cloth is 4x + 4 = 4(28) + 4 = 112 feet.
Answer: A. 56
Explanation: The area of the rectangle is 4x^2 - 16 = 4(28) - 16 = 112.
The area of the triangle is (1/2)(x - 4)(x - 4) = x^2 - 16.
Given that the area of each triangle is 70 square feet, we have x^2 - 16 = 70.
Solving for x, we get x = 28.
The perimeter of the original piece of square cloth is 4x + 4 = 4(28"

Output: 
Let x be the number of gallons of orange juice to be added.
Then, the total amount of soft drink will be (40+60+x) gallons.
The amount of orange juice in the soft drink will be (40x/100) gallons.
The amount of orange juice to be added will be (60x/100) gallons.
(40x/100) + (60x/100) = (40+60+x)(100/100)
x = (40+60+x)(100/100) - (40x/100)(60/100)
x = (40+60+x)(100/100) - (24x/100)(60/100)
x = (40+60+x)(100/100) - (24x/100)(60/100)

Output: 
Let the distance between the starting point and the starting point of the balls be d.
Then, the distance covered by ball A in 26 minutes = d/2
and the distance covered by ball B in 35 minutes = d/5
=> d/2 = d/5 * 5
=> d = 10
So, the distance between the starting point and the starting point of the balls is 10 meters.
Now, the distance covered by ball A in 26 minutes = 10/2 = 5 meters
and the distance covered by ball B in 35 minutes = 10/5 = 2 meters
=> 5 = 2
So, the balls will be at the same starting point again in 1 hour and 31 minutes.
