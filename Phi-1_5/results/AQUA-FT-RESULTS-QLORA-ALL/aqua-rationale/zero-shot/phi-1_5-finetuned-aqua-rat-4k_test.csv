Output: 
Let x be the cost of one soda and y be the cost of one energy bar.
Then,
150x + 300y = 150
150x + 150y = 300
x + 2y = 1
x + 3y = 2
6x + 7y =?
6x + 7y = 6x + 7y
6x + 7y = 6x + 7y
6x + 7y = 6x + 7y
6x + 7y = 6x + 7y
6x + 7y = 6x + 7y
6x + 7y = 6x + 7y
6x + 7y = 6x + 7y
6x + 7y = 6x + 7y
6x + 7y = 6x + 7y
6x + 7y = 6x + 7y
6x + 7y = 6x + 7y
6x + 7y = 6x + 7y
6x + 7y = 6x + 7y
6x + 7y = 6x + 7y
6x + 7y = 6x + 7y

Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year? options: A)20%, B)40%, C)50%, D)65%, E)75%
Output: 
Let the population of boomtown be x.
Then, x + 10% of x + 10% of x = 2
x + x + 10% of x + 10% of x = 2
2x + 20% of x = 2
2x + 0.2x = 2
2.2x = 2
x = 1.55
The population of boomtown is 1.55.
The percent population increase is (1.55 - 1) / 1 * 100 = 5%.

Output: 
Let the time taken by train A to reach Lucknow be t hours.
Then, distance covered by train A = 40t km.
Let the time taken by train B to reach Lucknow be t hours.
Then, distance covered by train B = 72t km.
Since, both trains start at the same time, the distance covered by train A is equal to the distance covered by train B.

How many students are there in the class? options: A)850, B)800, C)900, D)950, E)1000
Output: 
Let the total number of students be x.
Then, 8% of x = x/100 = 8x/100 = 8x/25 = 8x/25 = x/25
4/5 of x = x/25 = x/25 * 4 = x/5
10% of x = x/25 = x/25 * 10 = x/25
Remaining students = x - 8x/25 - x/5 - x/25 = x/25 - x/25 - x/25 - x/25 = x/25 - x/25 - x/25 - x/25 = x/25 - x/25 - x/25 - x/25 = x/25 - x/25 - x/25 - x/25 = x/25 - x/25 - x/25 - x/25 = x/25 - x/25 - x/25 - x/25 = x/25 - x/25 - x/25 - x/25 = x/25 - x/25 - x/25 - x/25 = x/25 - x/25 - x/25 - x/25 = x/25 - x/25"

Output: 
Perimeter of the plot = 340 m
Perimeter of the garden = (Perimeter of the plot + 2 x width of the garden)
= (340 + 2 x 1) m
= 340 m
Area of the garden = (Perimeter of the plot / 2) x (Perimeter of the garden / 2)
= (340 / 2) m2

Output: 
Let the total number of marbles in the bag be x.
Let the number of black marbles be y.
Then, y/x = 1/20
y = 1/20x
After the second time, the number of marbles in the bag is x - y = 19/20x.
The percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time is y/x = 1/20/19/20 = 1/200.
The percentage of black marbles in the bag is 1/200 * 100 = 5%.
The percentage of black marbles in the bag is 5%.

"John likes to have lightly flavored tea every evening. In a 50% strong milk tea, he replaces 15% of it with milk twice. Then, he replaces 10 percent of the resultant solution with more milk.
What is the final concentration of tea John drinks?","['A)15.38%', 'B)42%', 'C)39.86%', 'D)22.35%', 'E)32.51%']",E,"Instruction: John likes to have lightly flavored tea every evening. In a 50% strong milk tea, he replaces 15% of it with milk twice. Then, he replaces 10 percent of the resultant solution with more milk.
What is the final concentration of tea John drinks? options: A)15.38%, B)42%, C)39.86%, D)22.35%, E)32.51%
Output: 
Let the concentration of tea be x.
Then, the concentration of milk in the tea is 0.85x.
The concentration of milk in the tea after replacing 15% with milk twice is 0.85x*2 = 1.7x.
The concentration of milk in the tea after replacing 10% with more milk is 1.7x*0.9 = 1.05x.
The final concentration of tea John drinks is x*(1.05x/x) = 1.05x*(1.05x)/x = 1.05x*(1.05x)/x = 1.05x*(1.05x)/x = 1.05x*(1.05x)/x = 1.05x*(1.05x)/x = 1.05x*(1.05x)/x = 1.05x*(1.05x)/x = 1.05x*(1.05x)/x = 1.05x*(1.05x)/x = 1.05x*(1.05x)/x = 1.05x*(1.05x)/x = 1.05x"
