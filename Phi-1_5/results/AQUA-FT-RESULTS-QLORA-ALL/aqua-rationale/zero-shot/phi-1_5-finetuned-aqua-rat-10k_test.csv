Output: 
Let x be the number of files infected by a virus.
Then, 2.5x = number of files infected by both a virus and a worm.
0.5(250-x) = 2.5x

So, there are 250-20 = 230 files infected by a virus.
There are 2.5*20 = 50 files infected by both a virus and a worm.
Therefore, there are 230-50 = 180 files NOT infected by a worm.

Output: 
Let x be the minimum selling price per component.
The total revenue from selling 420 units at x is 420x.
The total production cost is $110 * 420 = $52,200.
The minimum profit is $626,400 - $52,200 = $530,200.
Therefore, 420x = 530,200
x = 530,200/420 = $230.
