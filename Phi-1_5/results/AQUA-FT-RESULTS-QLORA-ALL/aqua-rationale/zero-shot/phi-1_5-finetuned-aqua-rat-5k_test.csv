Output: 
Let x be the cost of one soda and y be the cost of one energy bar.
Then,
x + 2y = 150
x + 3y = 300
x = 150 - y
6(150 - y) + 7y = 600
y = 50
6(150 - 50) + 7y = 600
y = 100
6(150 - 100) + 7y = 600
y = 150
6(150 - 150) + 7y = 600
y = 150
6(150 - 150) + 7y = 600
y = 150
6(150 - 150) + 7y = 600

Let's say the minimum selling price per component is x.
The monthly profit is 420x - 110x = 380x.
The yearly profit is 380x * 12 = 4608x.
The yearly profit must be at least $626,400, so 4608x >= 626400.

What is the perimeter of the piece? options: A)60 m, B)61 m, C)62 m, D)63 m, E)64 m
Output: 
Let the breadth be x m.
Then, length = 4x + 1 m.
Perimeter = 2(length + breadth)
= 2(4x + x + 4x + 1)
= 2(9x + 1)
= 18x + 2
= 18x + 2 = 150
x = 15
Length = 4x + 1 = 46
Perimeter = 2(46 + 15) = 2(61) = 62 m.

Then, the concentration of milk in milk tea is 0.85(0.5x) = 0.425x.
Then, the concentration of milk in the resultant solution is 0.9(0.425x) = 0.39.86x.
Then, the concentration of milk in the solution is 10% of 0.39.86x = 0.094.86x.
