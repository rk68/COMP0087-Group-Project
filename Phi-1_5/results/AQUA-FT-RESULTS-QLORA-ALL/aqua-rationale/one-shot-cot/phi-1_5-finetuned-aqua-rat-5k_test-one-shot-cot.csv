Instruction: Boomtown urban planners expect the city’s population to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year? options: A)20%, B)40%, C)50%, D)65%, E)75%
Output: 
Let the population of boomtown be x.
Then, x(1+10/100) = 2x
x = 200
So, the population of boomtown in one year = 200.
The population of boomtown in two years = 400.
The percent population increase in boomtown over the last year = (400-200)/200 * 100 = 100%.

During 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, of which only 20 had tags from the previous year. If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)? options: A)300, B)500, C)5000, D)6000, E)7500
Output: Let N = the total number of deer in the forest.
During the first year, the percent of deer in the entire population with tags was: 300/N
20/500 is the percent of deer caught during the second year that had tags. Since this sample percent matches the percent for the entire population (i.e., the total number of tagged deer divided by the total number of deer), the two ratios are equal.

Output: If ball A makes 2 rotations in 26 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 13 minutes. If ball B makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 7 minutes.
The two balls start rotating now and makes several rotations before they are at the SAME starting points. Ball A would have done a WHOLE number X of rotations and ball B would have done a WHOLE number Y of rotations. Also they would have rotated during the same period of time T. Hence
T = 13 X = 7 Y
Hence 13 X = 7 Y
Solve the above for X
X = 7 Y / 13
We want the time when they are FIRST at the same starting point. Therefore X and Y are the smallest whole numbers of the equation X = 7 Y / 13. The smallest value of Y that gives X as a whole number is 13. Hence
X = 7 (13) / 13 = 7

Output: 
The minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 is
$626,400 = (420 x 110) - (420 x 110)
$626,400 = 462,400
$626,400 = 462,400
$626,400 = 462,400
$626,400 = 462,400
$626,400 = 462,400
$626,400 = 462,400
$626,400 = 462,400
$626,400 = 462,400
$626,400 = 462,400
$626,400 = 462,400
$626,400 = 462,400
$626,400 = 462,400
$626,400 = 462,400
$626,400 = 462,400
$626,400 = 462,400
$626,400 = 462,400
$626,400 = 462,400
$626,400 = 462,400
$626,400 = 462,400
$626,400 = 462,400
$626,400 = 462,400
$626,400 = 462,400

Instruction: One gram of a certain health food contains 9 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. If vitamins E and A are to be obtained from no other source, how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins? options: A)8.5, B)10.5, C)12.5, D)14.5, E)16.5
Output: 
Let x be the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and y be the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A.
Then, 9x/100 + 8y/100 = x + y
9x + 8y = x + y
9x = y
y = 9x/8
The minimum daily requirement of both vitamins is 9x/8.
The minimum daily requirement of vitamin E is 9x/8 * 9 = 81x/8.
The minimum daily requirement of vitamin A is 9x/8 * 8 = 72x/8.
The minimum daily requirement of the health food is 81x/8 + 72x/8 = 135x/8.
The minimum daily requirement of the health food is 135x/8 * 1 = 135x/8.
The minimum daily requirement of the health food is 135x/8 * 1 = 135x/8.
The minimum daily requirement of the health food is 135x/8 * 1 = 135x/8.
The minimum daily requirement of the health food is 135x/8 * 1 = 135x/8.
The minimum daily requirement of the health food is 135x/8 * 1 = 135x/8.
The minimum daily requirement of the health food is 135x/8 * 1 = 135x/8.

Instruction: John likes to have lightly flavored tea every evening. In a 50% strong milk tea, he replaces 15% of it with milk twice. Then, he replaces 10 percent of the resultant solution with more milk.
What is the final concentration of tea John drinks? options: A)15.38%, B)42%, C)39.86%, D)22.35%, E)32.51%
Output: 
Let the concentration of tea be x.
Then, the concentration of milk is 0.85x.
The concentration of milk in the tea is 0.15x.
The concentration of milk in the tea after the second replacement is 0.1(0.85x+0.15x)=0.085x.
The concentration of milk in the tea after the third replacement is 0.1(0.085x+0.15x)=0.087.5x.
The concentration of tea in the tea is x+0.087.5x=1.087.5x.
The concentration of tea is 15% of the total solution.
So, 15% of 1.087.5x=0.15x.
So, the concentration of tea is 15% of the total solution.
