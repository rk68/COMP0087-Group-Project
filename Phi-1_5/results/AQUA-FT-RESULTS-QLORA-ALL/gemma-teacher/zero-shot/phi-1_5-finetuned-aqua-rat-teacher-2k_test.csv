Output: 

The monthly salary S of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. To find the monthly sales, we need to first calculate the 5% of sales.

5% of sales = 0.05 x Sales

Since the monthly salary is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 and 5% of sales, we can write:

S = $500 + 0.05 x Sales

To reach a monthly salary of $1500, we need to solve for Sales:

$1500 = $500 + 0.05 x Sales

$1500 - $500 = 0.05 x Sales

$1000 = 0."

Output: 

The length of the rectangular piece is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth. So, the length is 4 times the breadth plus 1.

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:

Perimeter = 2(length + breadth)

Substituting the values of length and breadth into the formula, we get:

Perimeter = 2(4(4) + 1 + breadth)

Since the length is 1m more than the breadth, we can also write the length as 4 times the breadth plus 1.

Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangular piece is:

Perimeter = 2(4(4) + 1 + 4(4) + 1)

Perimeter = 2(16 +"

During the return journey, it increased its speed by 12km/hr and took 4 hours. What is the distance travelled by the jeep? options: A)126km, B)144km, C)127km, D)228km, E)128km
Output: 

The information provided is:

* Distance travelled = Unknown
* Time taken = 6 hours
* Speed increase = 12km/hr
* Time taken for return journey = 4 hours

We know that the formula for distance travelled is given by the formula:

Distance travelled = Speed x Time

Therefore, we can substitute the values of speed and time into this formula as:

Distance travelled = (Speed + 12) x 4

Substituting the values of speed and time into this formula, we get:

Distance travelled = (Speed + 12) x 4 = Distance travelled

Since the distance travelled is equal to the distance travelled in the forward journey, we can write"

Output: 

John has a 50% strong tea and replaces 15% of it with milk twice. So, the remaining tea is 50% - 15% = 35% of the original tea.

He replaces 10% of the resultant solution with more milk, which is 10% of 35% = 3.5%.

Therefore, the final concentration of tea John drinks is 35% - 3.5% = 32.5%.
