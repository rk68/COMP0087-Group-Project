Output: 

The cost of one soda is 150 cents, and the cost of two energy bars is 300 cents. Therefore, the cost of six sodas is 6 x 150 = 900 cents. The cost of seven bars is 7 x 300 = 2100 cents.

The total cost of six sodas and seven bars is 900 + 2100 = 3000 cents.

Output: 

The number of distinct bike no.'s that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s is given by the formula:

C(n,2) = n! / (n-2)! * 2!

where C(n,2) is the number of distinct bike no.'s that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s, n is the number of distinct bike no.'s, and 2! is the factorial of 2.

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:

C(2,2) = 2! / (2-2)! * 2! = 2!

Therefore, the total number of distinct bike no.'s that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s is 2! = 2.

Output: 

The area of a square is given by the formula A = s^2, where A is the area, s is the side length.

Given that the side length of the square is 20 cm, we can find the area as A = 20^2 = 400 cm^2.

The area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr^2, where A is the area, π is the constant of proportionality, and r is the radius.

Since the diameter of the square is 20 cm, the radius is 20/2 = 10 cm.

The area of the circle is A = π(10)^2 = 100π cm^2.

Output: 

The information provided is that a coin-diver gets 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin. Therefore, the minimum number of coins that she brought is the number that results in a total of $3.40.

To find the minimum number of coins, we need to find the number of coins that will result in a total of $3.40. To do this, we need to find the number of coins that will result in a total of 20 cents and the number of coins that will result in a total of 25 cents.

The number of coins that will result in a total of 20 cents is the number of coins that will result in a total of 20 cents multiplied by the number of coins that she brought.","Instruction: During one season, a tennis team won 20 matches and lost 30% of their matches.

Output: 

The wire is a rectangle of length 27 cm and breadth 17 cm. To form a square, the length of each side must be equal. Therefore, the side length of the square is 27 cm.

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = l*b, where A is the area, l is the length, and b is the breadth. Substituting the values of l and b into the formula, we get A = 27*17 = 450 gms.

The area of a square is given by the formula A = s^2, where A is the area and s is the side length. Substituting the value of A into the formula, we get s = 450/17 = 25 gms.

The formula for simple interest is given by the formula I = P*R*T, where I is the interest, P is the principal, R is the rate of interest, and T is the time period.

Given information:
P = Rs. 5000
I = Rs. 300
T = 3 years

We know that I = P*R*T, so we can substitute this into the formula as:
300 = 5000*R*3

To find the rate of interest per annum, we need to isolate R on one side of the equation.

R = 300/5000*3

R = 0.06

Output: 

The worker's average speed is 20 kilometers per hour and the distance to work is 9 kilometers. Therefore, the time taken to drive to work is 9 kilometers divided by 20 kilometers per hour, which is 0.45 hours.

The worker's average speed is 6 kilometers per hour and the distance to work is 9 kilometers. Therefore, the time taken to cycle to work is 9 kilometers divided by 6 kilometers per hour, which is 1.5 hours.

The total time taken to travel to work is 0.45 hours + 1.5 hours, which is 2.05 hours.

The total time taken to travel to work is 2.05 hours.

Output: 

The ship traveled 180 miles, so the speed of the ship is 180 miles per hour. The plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship, which is 10 * 180 = 1800 miles per hour. Therefore, the distance traveled by the plane is 1800 miles per hour * time taken = distance traveled.

Since the distance traveled is equal to the distance traveled by the ship, we can write:

Distance traveled by the ship = Distance traveled by the plane

Therefore, the distance traveled by the ship is 180 miles.

Instruction: Ram and Krishna start from A and B, respectively, at the same time and travel towards each other at constant speeds of 20m/s and 40m/s, respectively, along the same route. Ram meets Krishna at point C on the road after 10 seconds. Find the total distance between A to B. options: A)700 meters, B)1000 meters, C)700 kilometers, D)555 meters, E)600 meters
Output: 

The distance traveled by Ram is 10 meters per second, which is equivalent to 10 meters per second multiplied by 10 seconds, which is 100 meters. The distance traveled by Krishna is 20 meters per second, which is equivalent to 20 meters per second multiplied by 10 seconds, which is 200 meters. Therefore, the total distance traveled by both Ram and Krishna is 100 meters + 200 meters = 300 meters.

The total distance between A and B is 1 kilometer, which is equivalent to 1000 meters. Therefore, the total distance traveled by Ram and Krishna is 300 meters.

The answer is: B

Output: 

**Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled by Winson running to school.**
Distance traveled = Speed x Time
Distance traveled = 10 x 1 hour
Distance traveled = 10 miles

**Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled by Winson walking home.**
Distance traveled = Speed x Time
Distance traveled = 5 x 1 hour
Distance traveled = 5 miles

**Step 3: Calculate the total distance traveled.**
Total distance traveled = Distance traveled by Winson running to school + Distance traveled by Winson walking home
Total distance traveled = 10 miles + 5 miles

The given information is:

- The youngest member of the club is 7 years old.
- The sum of the ages of all the members is 250.
- The common difference between the ages of the members is 3 months.

We know that the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, so we can write:

7 + (n-1)3 = 250

where n is the number of members in the club.

Solving this equation, we get:

n = 25

Therefore, the number of members in the club is 25.

Output: 

The ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which will fit inside the cube is 2:π. This is because the volume of a cube is equal to the cube of its side length, and the volume of a sphere is equal to the cube of its radius cubed. Therefore, the volume of the sphere that will fit inside the cube is equal to the cube of its side length, which is equal to the side length of the cube.

The side length of the cube is equal to the distance between A and B, which is 180 miles.

The given information is:

We know that M > N and M - N + 396c = 990. So, we can find the values of M that are more than 300 by finding the values of M that make M - N + 396c = 900.

To find the values of M, we need to isolate M on one side of the equation.

M - N + 396c = 900
M = 990 + 396c

Now, we need to find the values of M that make M - N + 396c = 900.

The total distance traveled by A is 3km + 5km + 3km + 2km = 15km. Therefore, the remaining distance from home is 15km - 3km = 12km.

The number of friends who attended the picnic is 8. So, the number of friends who did not turn up is 12 - 8 = 4.

The extra contribution of each friend is Rs. 4. Therefore, the total extra contribution is 4 * 4 = Rs. 16.

- The speed of the second car is 52 mph.
- The time taken for the first car to cover the distance is 6 hours.
- The time taken for the second car to cover the distance is 4 hours.

Instruction: If 120 is reduced to 96, what is the reduction percent? options: A)30%, B)40%, C)20%, D)10%, E)5%
Output: 

The given information is:

* The height of the electric pole (H) is 14 metres.
* The length of the shadow (S) is 10 metres.
* The height of the tree (T) is unknown.

We know that the height of the tree (T) is equal to the height of the electric pole (H) multiplied by the ratio of the height of the tree (T) to the height of the electric pole (H).

Therefore, we can write:

T = H * H/S

Substituting the values of H and S into this equation, we get:

T = 14 * 14/10 = 14
