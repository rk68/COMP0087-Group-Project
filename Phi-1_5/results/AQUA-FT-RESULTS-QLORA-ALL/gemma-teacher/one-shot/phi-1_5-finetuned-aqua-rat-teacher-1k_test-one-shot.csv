Ram meets Krishna at point C on the road after 10 seconds. Find the total distance between A to B. options: A)700 meters, B)1000 meters, C)700 kilometers, D)555 meters, E)600 meters
Output: 

**Explanation:**

1. Calculate the distance traveled by Ram in 10 seconds. Distance traveled = Speed x Time = 20m/s x 10s = 200 meters.

2. Calculate the distance traveled by Krishna in 10 seconds. Distance traveled = Speed x Time = 40m/s x 10s = 400 meters.

3. Find the total distance traveled by both of them. Total distance traveled = Distance traveled by Ram + Distance traveled by Krishna = 200 meters + 400 meters = 600 meters.

**The answer is:** B

Therefore, the total distance between A to B is 700 meters.

Output: 

The monthly salary S of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. To reach a monthly salary of $1500, the monthly sales must be greater than $500.

To find the monthly sales, we need to first calculate the 5% of the monthly salary. This can be done as:

5% of $500 = $25

Now, we can add the fixed salary of $500 to the monthly sales to find the total monthly salary:

Total monthly salary = $500 + $25 = $525

Since the total monthly salary is equal to $1500, we can conclude that the monthly sales must be greater than $500.

Output: 

The volume of a cube is given by the formula V = a^3, where V is the volume of the cube and a is the length of one side of the cube. The volume of a sphere is given by the formula V = (4/3)πr^3, where V is the volume of the sphere and r is the radius of the sphere.

Since the volume of the cube is equal to the volume of the sphere, we can write:

V = (4/3)πr^3

Substituting the value of V from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

Output: 

The perimeter of a rectangular plot is given by the formula 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width of the plot. If the perimeter is 340 metres and the width is unknown, then we can find the width by dividing the perimeter by 2 and then multiplying by the length.

w = 340/2 = 170

The area of a rectangular plot is given by the formula lw, where l is the length and w is the width of the plot. If the area is unknown, then we can find the area by multiplying the length and width.

l = 1

lw = 1 * 170 = 170

Output: Answer: A

Instruction: If 120 is reduced to 96, what is the reduction percent? options: A)30%, B)40%, C)20%, D)10%, E)5%
Output: 

The given information is as follows:

The height of the electric pole (h) is 14 meters and the height of the tree (t) is unknown.

The shadow of the electric pole (s) is 10 meters and the shadow of the tree (t') is 15 meters.

We know that the height of the tree (t) is equal to the height of the electric pole (h) multiplied by the height of the tree's shadow (t') divided by the height of the electric pole's shadow (s).

Therefore, we can write the equation as:

t = h * t' / s

Substituting the values of h and t' into this equation, we get:

t = 14 * 15 / 10 = 21

The reduction in height is 21 - 14 = 7 meters.
