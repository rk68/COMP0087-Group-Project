"You can purchase one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents, or two sodas and three energy bars for 300
cents. If the costs of the items do not change, compute the cost in cents of six sodas and seven bars.","['A)500', 'B)600', 'C)750', 'D)800', 'E)900']",E,"Instruction: You can purchase one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents, or two sodas and three energy bars for 300
cents. If the costs of the items do not change, compute the cost in cents of six sodas and seven bars. options: A)500, B)600, C)750, D)800, E)900
Output: 
Let the cost of one soda be x cents and the cost of one energy bar be y cents.
Then, we have the following equations:
x + 2y = 150
2x + 3y = 300
Solving these equations, we get x = 50 cents and y = 25 cents.
So, the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars is 6(50) + 7(25) = 500 cents.
Answer: A)500
Explanation: Cost of one soda = 50 cents, cost of one energy bar = 25 cents.
Cost of six sodas and seven energy bars = 6(50) + 7(25) = 500 cents.

Output: 
Let the number of files infected by a virus be x.
Then the number of files infected by a worm is 2.5x.
The total number of files infected by both a virus and a worm is x + 2.5x = 3.5x.
50% of the files were not infected by a virus, so the number of files infected by a virus is 0.5x.
The number of files infected by a worm is 3.5x - 0.5x = 2.5x.
The number of files infected by both a virus and a worm is 3.5x - 0.5x = 2x.
The number of files infected by both a virus and a worm is 2.5x - 2x = 0.5x.
The number of files infected by both a virus and a worm is 2.5x - 0.5x = 2x.

Output: 
Let's assume that the minimum selling price per component is x.
The total revenue from selling 420 units of the component is 420x.
The total production cost is 110x.
The minimum profit is (420x - 110x) = 290x.
The minimum selling price per component is x = 290/420 = 0.57.
Answer: A) 226
Explanation: The minimum selling price per component is $0.57.
The total revenue from selling 420 units of the component is 420 * 0.57 = $226.
The total production cost is 110 * 0.57 = $59.70.
The minimum profit is (420 * 0.57 - 110 * 0.57) = $290.
Answer: A)

How much does each daughter receive ? options: A)Rs 400, B)Rs 500, C)Rs 600, D)Rs 700, E)Rs 800
Output: 
Let the amount received by each nephew be x.
Then, the amount received by each daughter is 4x.
And, the amount received by each son is 5x.

Total amount received by all nephews = 4x + 4x + 5x = 9x
Total amount received by all daughters = 4x + 4x = 8x
Total amount received by all sons = 5x = 5x
Total amount received by all nephews and all daughters = 9x + 8x + 5x = 17x
Total amount received by all nephews and all daughters = 8x = 8x
Total amount received by all nephews and all daughters = 17x = 17x
Total amount received by all nephews and all daughters = 17x = 17x

What is the speed of the elevator? options: A)1 step/minute, B)2 step/minute, C)3 step/minute, D)4 step/minute, E)None of the above
Output: 
Let's assume the speed of the elevator is x steps/min.
Then, the time taken to walk 20 steps = 20/x
Time taken to walk 10 steps = 10/x
10/x = 20/x
10x = 20x
x = 0
So, the speed of the elevator is 0 steps/min.

Output: 
2/3 of the number = (2/3)x
10 = (2/3)x - (2/3)x + (2/3)x
10 = (2/3)x + (2/3)x - (2/3)x

of 55. If the overall class average was 76, what percent of the class passed? options: A)44%, B)66%, C)68%, D)72%, E)75%
Output: 
Let the number of passing students be x and the number of failing students be y.
Then, x + y = n and 83x + 55y = 76n
Solving for x and y, we get x = (n - y)/2 and y = n - x/2
Substituting x and y in the equation 83x + 55y = 76n, we get
(n - y)/2 + (n - x/2)/2 = 76
Multiplying both sides by 2, we get
n - y + x - x/2 = 152
Solving for x and y, we get x = (n - y)/2 and y = n - x/2
Substituting x and y in the equation 83x + 55y = 76n, we get
(n - y)/2 + (n - x/2)/2 = 76
Multiplying both sides by 2, we get
n - y + x - x/2 = 152
Solving for x and y, we get x = (n - y)/2 and y = n - x/2

Output: 
Let the time taken by both machines to produce 10 yo-yos be x minutes.
Then,
Machine A will have produced 10/6 = 1.67 yo-yos in x minutes.
Machine B will have produced 10/9 = 1.11 yo-yos in x minutes.
So,
1.67 + 1.11 = 2.78 = 2.78x
x = 2.78x/2.78 = x = 1.11
Answer: C
Output: 1.11x = 1.11x/1.11 = 1.11
Answer: C
Output: 1.11x = 1.11x/1.11 = 1.11
Answer: C
Output: 1.11x = 1.11x/1.11 = 1.11
Answer: C
Output: 1.11x = 1.11x/1.11 = 1.11
Answer: C
Output: 1.11x = 1.11x/1.11 = 1.11
Answer: C
Output: 1.11x = 1.11x/1.11 = 1.11
