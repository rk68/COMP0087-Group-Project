"You can purchase one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents, or two sodas and three energy bars for 300
cents. If the costs of the items do not change, compute the cost in cents of six sodas and seven bars.","['A)500', 'B)600', 'C)750', 'D)800', 'E)900']",E,"Instruction: You can purchase one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents, or two sodas and three energy bars for 300
cents. If the costs of the items do not change, compute the cost in cents of six sodas and seven bars. options: A)500, B)600, C)750, D)800, E)900
Output: 
Let the cost of one soda be x cents and the cost of one energy bar be y cents.
Then, we have two equations:
x + 2y = 150
2x + 3y = 300
Solving these equations, we get x = 50 and y = 25.
The cost of six sodas and seven bars is 6x + 7y = 6(50) + 7(25) = 750 cents.

How much does each daughter receive ? options: A)Rs 400, B)Rs 500, C)Rs 600, D)Rs 700, E)Rs 800
Output: 
Let the amount received by each nephew be x.
Then, the amount received by each daughter is 4x.
And, the amount received by each son is 5x.
So, the total amount received by each nephew is 5x.
Total amount received by each daughter is 4x.
Total amount received by each son is 5x.
Total amount received by all nephews is 5x.
Total amount received by all daughters is 4x.
Total amount received by all sons is 5x.
Total amount received by all nephews and all daughters is 5x + 4x + 5x = 10x.
10x = 8600
x = 800
So, the amount received by each nephew is 800.
Amount received by each daughter = 4x = 4(800) = 3200.
Amount received by each son = 5x = 5(800) = 4000.
Total amount received by all nephews and all daughters = 10x = 10(800) = 8000.
Total amount received by all sons = 5x = 5(800) = 4000.
Total amount received by all nephews and all daughters = 8000 + 4000 + 4000 = 12000"

If Rahul is 2 yrs younger to Denis whose age is 5 yrs, then what is Ajay's present age? options: A)40, B)60, C)70, D)80, E)90
Output: 
Let the present age of Ajay be x.
Then, 6x - x = 18
5x = 18
x = 3.6
So, present age of Rahul = (3.6 - 2) = 1.6
Present age of Denis = (3.6 - 1.6) = 2.4
So, (3.6 - 2.4) / 18 = x
x = 1.6 / 18 = 0.0667
So, present age of Denis = 5 * 0.0667 = 0.4
So, (3.6 - 2.4 - 0.4) / 18 = x
x = 0.0667 / 18 = 0.0334
So, (3.6 - 2.4 - 0.4) / 18 = x
x = 0.0334 / 18 = 0.0334
So, (3.6 - 2.4 - 0.4) / 18 = x
x = 0.0334 / 18 = 0.0334
So, (3.6 - 2.4 - 0.4) / 18 = x
x = 0.0334 / 18 = 0."

Let the distance between A and B be d meters.
Then, the time taken by Ram to travel from A to B is d/20 seconds.
The time taken by Krishna to travel from B to A is d/40 seconds.
Since they meet at point C, the total time taken by both of them is 10 seconds.

How many helpers are required? options: A)8, B)10, C)12, D)15, E)19
Output: 
Let's assume that the number of assistants required is x.
Then, the number of large cakes that can be prepared in x hours = 2x
And the number of small cakes that can be prepared in x hours = 35x
Total number of cakes that can be prepared in 3 hours = 2x + 35x = 37x
Total number of cakes that are needed = 700
So, 37x = 700
x = 700/37

How many students are there in the class? options: A)850, B)800, C)900, D)950, E)1000
Output: 
Let the total number of students in the class be x.
Then, 8% of x = x/100 * 8 = x/10
4/5 of x = x/5 * 4 = x/2
10% of x = x/10 * 10 = x/2
20 students are not interested in any games.
So, x/2 + x/10 + x/2 = x
x/2 + x/5 + x/2 = x
x/2 + x/5 = x
x/5 = x/2
x = 5x/2
x = 5x/2 * 2 = 5x
x = 10x/2
x = 5x/2 * 2 = 10x/2
x = 10x/2 * 2 = 10x
x = 10x/2 * 2 = 10x
x = 10x/2 * 2 = 10x
x = 10x/2 * 2 = 10x
x = 10x/2 * 2 = 10x
x = 10x/2 * 2 = 10x
x = 10x/2 * 2 = 10x
x = 10x/2"

Output: 
Let Joe's age be x, his sister's age be y and father's age be z.
Then, x + y + z = 100
x = z
y = 2z
z = 2y
z = 2(2z)
z = 4z
z = 4(x)
4x = 100

What is the final concentration of tea John drinks?","['A)15.38%', 'B)42%', 'C)39.86%', 'D)22.35%', 'E)32.51%']",E,"Instruction: John likes to have lightly flavored tea every evening. In a 50% strong milk tea, he replaces 15% of it with milk twice. Then, he replaces 10 percent of the resultant solution with more milk.
What is the final concentration of tea John drinks? options: A)15.38%, B)42%, C)39.86%, D)22.35%, E)32.51%
Output: 
Let the concentration of tea be x.
Then, the concentration of milk in the tea is (50-15-10)/50 = (35/50)
The concentration of milk in the tea after replacing 15% with milk twice is (35-15*2)/35 = (35-30)/35 = 5/35
The concentration of milk in the tea after replacing 10% with more milk is (5-10*2)/5 = (5-20)/5 = -15/5 = -3/5
The final concentration of tea John drinks is x+3/5
The final concentration of milk is (35-15*2)/35 = (35-30)/35 = 5/35
The final concentration of tea John drinks is x+3/5+5/35 = x+3/35+5/35 = x+8/35
The final concentration of tea John drinks is 15.38%
