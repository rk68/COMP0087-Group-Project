cents. If the costs of the items do not change, compute the cost in cents of six sodas and seven bars. options: A)500, B)600, C)750, D)800, E)900
Output: 
Let the cost of one soda be x cents and the cost of one energy bar be y cents.
Then,
x + 2y = 150
2x + 3y = 300
Solving the first equation for x, we get x = 50 cents.
Solving the second equation for y, we get y = 100 cents.
The cost of six sodas and seven energy bars is 6x + 7y = 6(50) + 7(100) = 500 cents.

If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum? options: A)36 grams, B)40 grams, C)42 grams, D)48 grams, E)50 grams
Output: 
Let the weight of pure aluminum be x grams.
Then, the weight of the coin = x + 30 grams.
The volume of aluminum in the alloy = 2 x 15 mm = 30 mm
The volume of silver in the alloy = 2 x 15 mm = 30 mm
The ratio of the weight of silver to the weight of aluminum = 2 : 1
(30 + x)/x = 2 : 1
2x = 60
x = 30
The weight of the coin = 30 + 30 = 60 grams.
The weight of the coin = 60 + 30 = 90 grams.
The weight of the coin = 90 grams.

Then the number of files infected by a worm is 2.5x.
The number of files infected by both a virus and a worm is 250 - x - 2.5x = 225 - 3.5x.
50% of the files were not infected by a virus, so the number of files that were not infected by a virus is 0.5(250 - x - 2.5x) = 125 - x.

What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought?","['A)4', 'B)3', 'C)2', 'D)1', 'E)0']",C,"Instruction: For bringing each copper coin from the bottom of a river, a coin-diver gets 20 cents, and for each brass coin she gets 25 cents. If after one dive, she got $3.40. What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought? options: A)4, B)3, C)2, D)1, E)0
Output: 
Let's assume that she brought x copper coins and y brass coins.
Then, the total value of the coins she brought is 20x + 25y cents.
We know that the total value is $3.40, which is equal to 340 cents.
So, 20x + 25y = 340
=> x + y = 17
=> x = 17 - y
Now, we can substitute x = 17 - y into the equation x = 17 - y and solve for y.
17 - y = 17 - y
=> y = 0
So, the minimum number of copper coins that she brought is 17 - 0 = 17 coins.

How many members does the group have now, if the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3? options: A)277, B)288, C)200, D)277, E)168
Output: 
Let the number of boys and girls join the group be x.
Then,
4x + 3x = 64 + 40
7x = 104
x = 13.14
Since x is a whole number, we can say that x = 13.
The ratio of boys to girls is 4:3.
So, the number of boys in the group = 4x = 4(13) = 52
The number of girls in the group = 3x = 3(13) = 39

Assistants are needed to prepare for preparation. Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes/hr. The kitchen is available for 3 hours and 20 large cakes & 700 small cakes are needed. How many helpers are required?,"['A)8', 'B)10', 'C)12', 'D)15', 'E)19']",B,"Instruction: Assistants are needed to prepare for preparation. Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes/hr. The kitchen is available for 3 hours and 20 large cakes & 700 small cakes are needed. How many helpers are required? options: A)8, B)10, C)12, D)15, E)19
Output: 
Let's assume that the number of assistants required is x.
Then, the number of large cakes that can be prepared in x hours = 2x
The number of small cakes that can be prepared in x hours = 35x
The total number of cakes that can be prepared in 3 hours = 2x + 35x = 47x
The total number of cakes that are needed = 2x + 700 = 7x
7x = 20
x = 20/7
x = 2.86
Since the number of assistants cannot be a decimal, we round up to the nearest whole number.
Therefore, the number of assistants required is 3.
