"You can purchase one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents, or two sodas and three energy bars for 300
cents. If the costs of the items do not change, compute the cost in cents of six sodas and seven bars.","['A)500', 'B)600', 'C)750', 'D)800', 'E)900']",E,"Instruction: You can purchase one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents, or two sodas and three energy bars for 300
cents. If the costs of the items do not change, compute the cost in cents of six sodas and seven bars. options: A)500, B)600, C)750, D)800, E)900
Output: 
Let the cost of one soda be x cents and the cost of one energy bar be y cents.
Then,
x + 2y = 150
x + 3y = 300
Solving these equations, we get x = 50 and y = 50.
So, the cost of six sodas and seven bars is 6(50) + 7(50) = 500 cents.
Answer: A. 500
Explanation:
Let the cost of one soda be x cents and the cost of one energy bar be y cents.

Output: 
Let the side of the square be x.
Then, the area of the square is x^2.
Let the diameter of the circle be y.
Then, the area of the circle is (y/2)^2.
The area of the remaining paper is x^2 - y^2.

Output: 
Let the number of copper coins be x.
Then, the number of brass coins is (x-20).
The total amount of money she got is 20x + 25(x-20) = 3.40
=> 20x + 25x - 500 = 3.40

Output: 
Let the number of boys be 4x and the number of girls be 3x.
Then, 4x + 3x = 64 + 40 = 104
x = 4
So, the number of boys is 4x = 16 and the number of girls is 3x = 12.
The ratio of boys to girls is 4:3.
So, the number of boys is 4x = 16 and the number of girls is 3x = 12.

If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ? options: A)Rs 400, B)Rs 500, C)Rs 600, D)Rs 700, E)Rs 800
Output: 
Let the amount of money each nephew receives be x.
Then, the amount of money each nephew receives is 4x.
Let the amount of money each son receives be y.
Then, the amount of money each son receives is 5y.
Let the amount of money each daughter receives be z.
Then, the amount of money each daughter receives is 4z.
The total amount of money divided among the 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews is Rs 8600.
So, x + 4x + 5y + 4z + 5y + 4z = Rs 8600
=> 10x + 9y = Rs 800
=> x = Rs 800/10
=> x = Rs 80
So, each nephew receives Rs 80.
=> Each nephew receives 4x = 4* Rs 80 = Rs 320.
=> Each nephew receives 4x = 4* Rs 80 = Rs 320.
=> Each nephew receives 4x = 4* Rs 80 = Rs 320.
=> Each nephew receives 4x = 4* Rs 80 = Rs 320.
=> Each nephew receives 4x = 4* Rs 80 = Rs 320.
=> Each nephew receives 4x = 4* Rs 80 ="

Output: 
Let the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E be x and the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A be y.
Then, 9x + 8y = 9x + 8y
=> x = y
Hence, the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins is y = y
Hence, the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins is y = y
Hence, the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins is y = y
Hence, the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins is y = y
Hence, the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins is y = y
Hence, the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins is y = y
Hence, the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins is y = y
Hence, the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins is y = y
Hence, the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins is y = y
Hence, the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins is y = y

How old is Ajay today if Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years options: A)18, B)25, C)15, D)20, E)21
Output: 
Sachin's age 10 years ago = 2 * Ajay's age 10 years ago
Sachin's age now = 2 * (Ajay's age now - 10)
Sachin's age in 10 years = 40
2 * Ajay's age now = 2 * (40 - 10)
2 * Ajay's age now = 2 * 30
Ajay's age now = 15
Answer: C.
Explanation:
Sachin's age 10 years ago = 2 * Ajay's age 10 years ago
Sachin's age now = 2 * (Ajay's age now - 10)
Sachin's age in 10 years = 40
2 * Ajay's age now = 2 * (40 - 10)
2 * Ajay's age now = 2 * 30
Ajay's age now = 15
Answer: C.
Explanation:
Sachin's age 10 years ago = 2 * Ajay's age 10 years ago
Sachin's age now = 2 * (Ajay's age now - 10)
Sachin's age in 10 years = 40

Output: 
Let the height of building be x metres.
Then, the length of the shadow of the building is (17.5 x x)/40.25 = (x/40.25)
(x/28.75) = (17.5 x x)/40.25

The height of the room is:,"['A)2.6m', 'B)3.9m', 'C)4m', 'D)4.2m', 'E)4.4m']",C,"Instruction: The height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. The height of the room is: options: A)2.6m, B)3.9m, C)4m, D)4.2m, E)4.4m
Output: 
Let the height of the room be x.
Then, the length of the room is (2x + 5)
The area of the room is (2x + 5)(x + 15) = 15x + 75
The area of the paper is (2x + 5)(x + 15) = 15x + 75
The cost of paper is (2x + 5)(x + 15) = 15x + 75
The cost of paper is Rs.260
(2x + 5)(x + 15) = 15x + 75
2x + 5x + 75 = 15x + 75
3x = 0
x = 0
The height of the room is 3.9m.
Answer: B.
The length of the room is (2x + 5) = (2 x 0 + 5) = 5
The area of the room is (2x + 5)(x + 15) = 15x + 75
The area of the paper is (2x + 5)(x + 15) = 15x + 75
The cost of paper is (2x + 5)(x + 15) = 15x + 75

Output: 
Let the income be x.
70% of x = x
x = 1.2x
x + 20% of x = 1.2x + 0.2x = 1.4x
1.4x = 1.6x

What is the perimeter of the piece? options: A)60 m, B)61 m, C)62 m, D)63 m, E)64 m
Output: 
Let the breadth of the piece be x.
Then, length of the piece = 4x + 1
Perimeter of the piece = 2(x + 4x + 1) = 2(5x + 1) = 10x + 2
= 150
10x + 2 = 150
10x = 148
x = 14.8
So, breadth of the piece = 14.8 m
Length of the piece = 4x + 1 = 4(14.8) + 1 = 62.4 + 1 = 63 m
