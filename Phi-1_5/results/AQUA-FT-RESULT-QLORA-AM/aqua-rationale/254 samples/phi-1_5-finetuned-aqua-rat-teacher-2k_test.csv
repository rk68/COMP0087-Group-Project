Instruction: Find the total no. of distinct bike no.'s that can beformed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s. How many letters need to be distinct? options: A)74453, B)64543, C)74325, D)65000, E)97656
Output: 

To form a distinct bike no. using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s, we need to choose 2 letters from a total of 2 letters.

The number of distinct bike no.s that can be formed is given by the formula:

C(n,2) = n! / (n-2)! * 2!

where C(n,2) is the number of distinct bike no.s that can be formed using n letters, n-2 is the number of letters that need to be distinct, and 2! is the factorial of 2.

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:

C(2,2) = 2! / (2-2)! * 2! = 2!

Therefore, the total number of distinct bike no.s that can be formed is 2! = 2.

Instruction: Boomtown urban planners expect the city’s population to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year? options: A)20%, B)40%, C)50%, D)65%, E)75%
Output: 

The population of Boomtown is expected to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago.

To find the percent population increase, we need to calculate the percentage increase in population over one year. To do this, we need to find the percentage increase in population over one year, which is 10%.

To find the percent population increase over two years, we need to multiply the percent population increase over one year by 2. This will give us the percent population increase over two years, which is 20%.

Instruction: A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper? options: A)8.75, B)8.79, C)8.75, D)8.71, E)8.72
Output: 
The area of a square is given by the formula A = s^2, where A is the area and s is the side length.
The area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius.
If the side length of a square is 20 cm, then the area of the square is 20^2 = 400 cm^2.
If two semi circles are drawn on the opposite sides of the square, then the area of each semi circle is πr^2 = π(20)^2 = 400π cm^2.
Therefore, the total area of the two semi circles is 2 * 400π = 800π cm^2.

Instruction: Two ants are moving from their farms towards each other. Ant A is moving at a speed of 9 cm per hour and ant B is moving at a speed of 6 cm per hour. If the farms are 75 cm away from each other, what will be the distance (in cm) that ant A travels until meeting ant B? options: A)45, B)48, C)51, D)54, E)57
Output: 

The distance traveled by ant A is given by the formula:

Distance traveled = Speed x Time

Time taken by ant A = Distance/Speed

Time taken by ant B = Distance/Speed

Since the distance traveled by ant A and ant B is the same, we can equate the two expressions for time taken:

Time taken by ant A = Time taken by ant B

Substituting the values of speed and distance into this equation, we get:

9 = 6x

x = 15 cm

Therefore, the distance traveled by ant A until meeting ant B is 15 cm.

Output: Jack did 2/3 of the work, which is 8 hours. So if Jack would finish the job this would take him 4 extra hours. Jill's rate is 5% of what Jack would do in those 4 hours. That means it would take her ten times as much time as Jack put into the job. 5*4 equals 20, answer E. Answer: E

Instruction: A sales person gets a 10% commission on each sale he makes. How many sales of $250 each must he make in order to reach a salary of at least $1000? options: A)15, B)24, C)25, D)40, E)52
Output: 

The sales person gets a 10% commission on each sale he makes. So, for each sale, he earns 10% of the sale price as commission. To reach a salary of at least $1000, he must make enough sales to earn a total commission of at least $1000.

To find out how many sales he must make, we need to divide $1000 by 10% (or 0.1). This will give us the number of sales he must make to reach a salary of at least $1000.

$1000 / 0.1 = $10,000

Output: If ball A makes 2 rotations in 26 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 13 minutes. If ball B makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 7 minutes.
The two balls start rotating now and makes several rotations before they are at the SAME starting points. Ball A would have done a WHOLE number X of rotations and ball B would have done a WHOLE number Y of rotations. Also they would have rotated during the same period of time T. Hence
T = 13 X = 7 Y
Hence 13 X = 7 Y
Solve the above for X
X = 7 Y / 13
We want the time when they are FIRST at the same starting point. Therefore X and Y are the smallest whole numbers of the equation X = 7 Y / 13. The smallest value of Y that gives X as a whole number is 13. Hence
X = 7 (13) / 13 = 7
Time T is given by
T = 13 X = 13 * 7 = 91 minutes = 1 hour and 31 minutes

Output: 

The ratio of the two numbers is 3:5. If 9 is subtracted from each number, the new numbers are 12 and 23. The smaller number is the number that is in the ratio 3:5. Therefore
3/5 = 12/23
3 = 12/23

Output: If ball A makes 2 rotations in 26 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 13 minutes. If ball B makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 7 minutes.
The two balls start rotating now and makes several rotations before they are at the SAME starting points. Ball A would have done a WHOLE number X of rotations and ball B would have done a WHOLE number Y of rotations. Also they would have rotated during the same period of time T. Hence
T = 13 X = 7 Y
Hence 13 X = 7 Y

Instruction: A wire in the shape of rectangle of length 27 cm and breadth 17 cm is rebent to form a square. What will be the measure of each side? options: A)9, B)11, C)22, D)25, E)31
Output: 

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = l*b, where A is the area, l is the length, and b is the breadth.

Given the length of the rectangle is 27 cm and the breadth is 17 cm, we can find the area as A = 27*17 = 441 square cm.

To form a square, the area of the square is given by the formula A = s^2, where A is the area and s is the side length.

Since the area of the square is equal to the area of the rectangle, we can find the side length as s = √(A/b) = √(441/17) = 11 cm.

Instruction: Professors borrowed Rs. 5000 from the university at simple interest. After 3 years, the university got Rs. 300 on interest. What was the rate of interest per annum? options: A)2%, B)8%, C)5%, D)10%, E)None of these
Output: 

The formula for simple interest is given by the formula I = P*R*T, where I is the interest, P is the principal, R is the rate of interest, and T is the time period.

Given information:
P = Rs. 5000
I = Rs. 300
T = 3 years

We know that I = P*R*T, so we can substitute this into the formula as:
300 = 5000*R*3

To find the rate of interest per annum, we need to isolate R on one side of the equation.

R = 300/5000*3

R = 0.06

Output: 

The company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost of $110 per unit, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. So, the total cost of production per month is 420 x $110 = $54,600. The total revenue from sales is 420 x $1 = $420. Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 is $626,400 - $54,600 = $5,400.

Output: Let, the amount Mohan and Sohan receive be Rs. m and Rs. n, respectively. The amount that they receive 3 years and 2 years after should be equal.
⇒m(1+4/100)3=n(1+4/100)2
⇒m(1+4/100)=n
⇒m(26/25)=n
⇒m/n=25/26
Therefore, Rs.5100 must be distribued in the ratio 25 : 26
So Mohan's share = 5100×25/(25+26)=2500
Answer B Answer: B

Instruction: A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point. options: A)238, B)289, C)200, D)287, E)187
Output: 

The ship traveled 180 miles, so the speed of the ship is 180 miles per hour. The plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship, so its speed is 10x180 miles per hour = 1800 miles per hour.

When they meet, the distance traveled is equal to the speed of the ship multiplied by the time traveled. So, the distance traveled is 180 miles.

Therefore, the distance traveled by the ship is 180 miles.

The distance traveled by the plane is 1800 miles per hour multiplied by the time traveled, which is the same as the distance traveled by the ship. So, the distance traveled by the plane is 180 miles.

The distance traveled by the ship and the plane is equal to the distance traveled by the ship, which is 180 miles.

Therefore, the distance traveled by the ship and the plane is 200 miles.

Question 1: A car travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour. If the car travels for 3 hours, how many miles does it cover?

Solution:
The formula for distance traveled is given by the formula: Distance = Speed x Time.

Given that the speed is 60 miles per hour and the time is 3 hours, we can substitute these values into the formula as follows:

Distance = 60 x 3 = 180 miles

Therefore, the car covers a distance of 180 miles.

The answer is: 180 miles

Instruction: One gram of a certain health food contains 9 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. If vitamins E and A are to be obtained from no other source, how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins? options: A)8.5, B)10.5, C)12.5, D)14.5, E)16.5
Output: 

The health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. To obtain the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, the health food must contain a minimum of 100% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 100% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A.

To find the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E, we need to calculate the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E based on the percentage of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E that the health food contains.

Minimum daily requirement of vitamin E = 100% * 9% = 9 grams

To find the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A, we need to calculate the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A based on the percentage of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A that the health food contains.

Minimum daily requirement of vitamin A = 100% * 8% = 8 grams

Therefore, the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins is 9 grams.

The number is 2/3 of the original number.

To find the number, we need to find the value of 2/3 of the original number.

2/3 of the original number = 2/3 * x

The sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number = 40 + 1/3 * x

Therefore, we can write:

2/3 * x = 40 + 1/3 * x

2/3 * x - 40 = 1/3 * x

2/3 * x - 1/3 * x = 40

Instruction: The monthly salary S of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. What should the monthly sales be so that her monthly salary reaches $1500? options: A)$50000, B)$40000, C)$30000, D)$20000, E)None of these
Output: 

The monthly salary S of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. So, we need to find the monthly sales that will result in a salary of $1500.

We know that S = 500 + 0.05x, where x is the monthly sales.

Therefore, we need to find the value of x that makes S = $1500.

500 + 0.05x = 1500

0.05x = 1000

x = $20,000

The answer is: B

The monthly sales should be $20,000 to reach a salary of $1500.

Output: 

The points A,B,C,D,E and F form a regular pentagon. To form a quadrilateral, we need to choose 4 points from the 5 points.

The number of ways to choose 4 points from 5 points is given by the formula:

C(n,r) = n! / (n-r)!r!

where C(n,r) is the number of ways to choose r points from n points, n! is the factorial of n, and r! is the factorial of r.

Substituting the values of n and r into the formula, we get:

C(5,4) = 5! / (5-4)!4! = 5

Therefore, the number of different quadrilaterals that can be formed by joining 4 of the points A,B,C,D,E and F is 5.

Instruction: What will be the cost of gardening 1-metre – broad boundary around a rectangular plot having perimeter of 340 metres at the rate of 10 per square metre? options: A)3400, B)1700, C)3440, D)Cannot be determined, E)None of these
Output: 

The perimeter of a rectangular plot is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

Given the perimeter is 340 metres and the rate of gardening is 10 per square metre, we can find the length and width of the plot as follows:

P = 2(l + w)
340 = 2(l + w)
l + w = 170

Since the ratio of red to green sweets is 3:4, we know that the length of the plot is 3/4 of the perimeter. Therefore, the length of the plot is:

l = 3/4(170) = 135 metres

The cost of gardening 1-metre – broad boundary around a rectangular plot having perimeter of 340 metres at the rate of 10 per square metre is:

Instruction: Joe's age, Joe's sister's age and Joe’s fathers age sums up to 100. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Find the age of Joe's father? options: A)45, B)48, C)50, D)55, E)58
Output: 

**Step 1:**

Let's assume Joe's age is x, his sister's age is y and father's age is z.

**Step 2:**

We know that x + y + z = 100.

**Step 3:**

When Joe is as old as his father, x = z.

**Step 4:**

When Joe is as old as his father, y = 2z.

**Step 5:**

Substituting the value of x from step 2 into the equation from step 3, we get:

z = 100 - y

**Step 6:**

Substituting the value of y from step 4 into the equation from step 5, we get:

z = 2(2z) = 4z

**Step 7:**

Since z = 100, we can substitute this value into the equation from step 6 to get:

4z = 100

z = 25

**The answer is:** C

Therefore, the age of Joe's father is 25.

**Note:** The answer is 25.

**The answer is:** C

Instruction: If a subscription for 15 issues of a magazine costs $42.00 and represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices, what is the cover price per issue? options: A)$7.73, B)$6.73, C)$5.73, D)$4.73, E)$3.73
Output: 

The given information is:

- Subscription cost = $42.00
- Number of issues = 15
- Savings = 25%

We know that the cost of a subscription is directly proportional to the number of issues and the savings. Therefore, we can write:

Subscription cost = Number of issues × Cost per issue

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:

$42.00 = 15 × Cost per issue

Cost per issue = $42.00 / 15 = $2.40

Output: 

The area of a trapezium is given by the formula A = 1/2(b+h)(b-h), where A is the area, b is the length of the base, and h is the height.

Given the area of cross-section is 640 square meters and the width of the canal is 10 m, we can find the height of the trapezium by rearranging the formula as h = (A/b)^2 = (640/10)^2 = 64 square meters.

Therefore, the depth of the canal is 64 meters.

Output: 

The first step is to find out the number of marbles that were painted black. 20 marbles were painted black, so the remaining marbles are white.

The second step is to find out the number of marbles that were returned to the bag. 20 marbles were returned, so the total number of marbles in the bag is now 20 + 20 = 40 marbles.

Output: 

The length of the rectangular piece is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth. So, the length is 4 times the breadth plus 1m.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:

Perimeter = 2(length + breadth)

Substituting the values of length and breadth into the formula, we get:

Perimeter = 2(4(x+1) + x)

where x is the breadth of the rectangular piece.

Simplifying the equation will lead to:

Perimeter = 2(5x + 1)

Perimeter = 10x + 2

Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangular piece is 10x + 2.

Instruction: M = abc is a three digit number and N = cba, if M > N and M - N + 396c = 990. Then how many values of M are more than 300. options: A)20, B)30, C)40, D)200, E)None
Output: 

The given information is:

M = abc
N = cba
M - N + 396c = 990

We know that M > N and M - N + 396c = 990. So, we can find the values of M that are more than 300.

To find the values of M, we need to find the values of M that make M - N + 396c > 300.

To do this, we need to find the values of M that make M - N + 396c = 900.

To find the values of M, we need to isolate M on one side of the equation.

M - N + 396c = 900
M = 900 + N + 396c

Now, we need to find the values of M that make M - N + 396c > 300.

M - N + 396c > 300
M - N > 300

Substituting this into the equation above, we get:

900 + N + 396c > 300
900 + N > 300
N > 300 - 900
N > 600

Therefore, the values of M that are more than 300 are 600.

Instruction: Machine A puts out a yo-yo every 6 minutes. Machine B puts out a yo-yo every 9 minutes. After how many minutes will they have produced 10 yo-yos? options: A)24 minutes, B)32 minutes, C)36 minutes, D)64 minutes, E)72 minutes
Output: 

The question is asking how many minutes it will take for two machines to produce 10 yo-yos.

The first step is to find out how many yo-yos each machine will produce in one minute.

Machine A produces 1 yo-yo every 6 minutes, so it will produce 1/6 of a yo-yo in one minute.

Machine B produces 1 yo-yo every 9 minutes, so it will produce 1/9 of a yo-yo in one minute.

To produce 10 yo-yos, both machines will need to produce a total of 10/1 = 10 yo-yos.

The number of minutes it will take for both machines to produce 10 yo-yos is 10/1 = 10 minutes.

Instruction: A jeep travels a certain distance taking 6 hours in the forward journey. During the return journey, it increased its speed by 12km/hr and took 4 hours. What is the distance travelled by the jeep? options: A)126km, B)144km, C)127km, D)228km, E)128km
Output: 

The relative speed of the jeep is increased by 12km/hr, therefore the speed of the return journey is 52km/hr.

The time taken for the return journey is 4 hours.

The distance travelled by the jeep is equal to the distance travelled in the forward journey multiplied by the speed of the return journey.

Distance travelled = Distance travelled in the forward journey * Speed of return journey

Distance travelled = 6 hours * 52km/hr = 312km

Instruction: If 120 is reduced to 96, what is the reduction percent? options: A)30%, B)40%, C)20%, D)10%, E)5%
Output: 

The given information is:

* Original value (x) = 120
* Reduced value (y) = 96

We know that x = 120 and y = 96.

The formula for reduction percent is:

Reduction percent = (x - y) / x * 100%

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:

Reduction percent = (120 - 96) / 120 * 100%

Reduction percent = 24 / 120 * 100%

Reduction percent = 20%

Instruction: Tires of a certain brand, when purchased new, last for four years. A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year. The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires? options: A)8%, B)10%, C)12.5%, D)16.7%, E)25%
Output: 

The cost of repairing the current tires is $40 per tire, which means that the average cost per year of repairing the current tires is $40. The cost of purchasing the new tires is $180 per tire, which means that the average cost per year of purchasing the new tires is $180. Therefore, the cost per year of repairing the current tires is $40 - $180 = -$140. The cost per year of purchasing the new tires is $180 - $140 = $40. The difference in cost per year is $40 - $140 = -$100. The percentage increase in cost per year is -100/140 * 100% = -71.43%.

**Explanation:**

1. Calculate the amount saved by the man per month. 12 1/2% of his income is Rs. 420.
2. Subtract the amount saved from the total income to find the remaining income. Rs. 3500 - Rs. 420 = Rs. 3380.
3. Multiply the remaining income by the savings rate to find the amount saved. Rs. 3380 * 12 1/2% = Rs. 420.

Therefore, the answer is B) Rs. 4270.

The answer is: B)","Instruction: Boomtown urban planners expect the city’s population to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year? options: A)20%, B)40%, C)50%, D)65%, E)75%
Output: Population now - 100;
Population one year from now - 110;
Population two years from now - 121;
Since the population two years from now (121) is exactly double the population one year ago then the population one year ago was 121/2=60.5.
Now, the question asks about the population increase over the last year, so from 60.5 (last year) to 100 (now): percent increase=difference/original*100=(100-60.5)/60.5*100=39.5/60.5*100=~2/3*100=~65%.

Instruction: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower? options: A)5(√3 + 1), B)6(√3 + √2), C)7(√3 – 1), D)8(√3 – 2), E)None of these
Output: 

The car is being driven towards the base of a vertical tower, and the angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60° in 10 minutes. The time taken to cover the distance is directly proportional to the speed of the car.

The formula for the time taken to cover a distance is given by the formula:

Time taken = Distance/Speed

where Distance is the distance covered, and Speed is the speed of the car.

Therefore, we can find the speed of the car by rearranging the formula as:

Speed = Distance/Time taken

Speed = Distance/10

Speed = Distance/10 * 10 = Distance/100

Now, we can find the distance covered by the car using the formula:

Distance covered = Speed * Time taken

Distance covered = Distance/100 * 10 = Distance/10

The distance covered by the car is 1400 grams.

The angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60° in 10 minutes. Therefore, the additional time taken to cover the distance is:

Additional time taken = Distance/Speed = 1400/Speed * 10 = Distance/Speed * 10

The additional time taken is 252 grams.

ANSWER B Answer: B

Instruction: A certain liquid passes through a drain at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds. At that rate, how many minutes will it take y gallons to pass through the drain? options: A)y/(1200xy), B)20xy/w, C)5xy/(12w), D)w/(3xy), E)3y/(wx)
Output: 

The formula for the time taken to pass through a drain is given by the formula:

$$t = \frac{v}{w}$$

where t is the time taken, v is the volume of liquid passing through the drain, and w is the rate of flow of liquid.

Given that the volume of liquid passing through the drain is y gallons and the rate of flow of liquid is w gallons per second, we can substitute these values into the formula as:

$$t = \frac{y}{w}$$

Substituting the value of w as 25 gallons per second, we get:

$$t = \frac{y}{25}$$

Therefore, the time taken to pass through the drain is y/25 seconds.

To convert this time to minutes, we need to multiply the time taken by 25 seconds by 60 seconds per minute:

$$t = \frac{y}{25} \times 60 = y/25 * 60$$

Therefore, the time taken to pass through the drain is y/25 * 60 seconds.

Output: 

The question asks for the number of minutes it would take two friends to empty a jar full of candies. We know that P can finish the candies in 10 minutes and Q can finish half the jar in 5 minutes. Therefore, if they are eating simultaneously, they will finish the candies in 10 + 5 = 15 minutes.

Output: 

The number of defective staplers produced is 10% of the total number of staplers produced, which is 10% of the total number of staplers produced. Therefore, the number of defective staplers produced is 10% of the total number of staplers produced.

The number of non-defective staplers produced is 100% - 10% = 90% of the total number of staplers produced. Therefore, the number of non-defective staplers produced is 90% of the total number of staplers produced.

If 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected, then the number of defective staplers produced is 72.

The total number of staplers produced is 72 + 90% of the total number of staplers produced.

Therefore, the total number of staplers produced is 72 + 90% of the total number of staplers produced.

The total number of staplers produced is 72 + 90% of the total number of staplers produced.

The total number of staplers produced is 72 + 90% of the total number of staplers produced.

The total number of staplers produced is 72 + 90% of the total number of staplers produced.

Instruction: At the of his one-year investment, Charles received $54,080, including interest and principal from a certain investment. If the investment paid an annual interest of 8 percent compounded semi-annually, which of the following is the amount of money that Charles originally invested? options: A)$45,000, B)$50,000, C)$54,000, D)$59,000, E)$62,000
Output: 

The formula for compound interest is given by the formula A = Pe(r/n)n^(n*t), where A is the future value, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year, and t is the number of years.

We know that A = $54,080, r = 8%, n = 2, and t = 1. So, we can substitute these values into the formula as follows:

$54,080 = $45,000(0.08/2)2(1)

$54,080 = $45,000(0.04)2(1)

$54,080 = $45,000(0.02)2(1)

$54,080 = $45,000(0.01)2(1)

$54,080 = $45,000(0.001)2(1)

$54,080 = $45,000(0.0001)2(1)

$54,080 = $45,000(0.0001)2(1)

$54,080 = $45,000(0.0001)2(1)

$54,080 = $45,000(0.0001)2(1)

$54,080 = $45,000(0","Instruction: The sum of the digits of a three digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109.

Output: 

**Step 1: Calculate the time spent driving to B.**

Time spent driving to B = Distance/Speed = 70 miles/70 mph = 1 hour

**Step 2: Calculate the time spent driving back to A.**

Time spent driving back to A = Distance/Speed = 70 miles/90 mph = 0.77 hours

**Step 3: Calculate the total time spent driving.**

Total time spent driving = 1 hour + 0.77 hours = 1.77 hours

**Step 4: Calculate the distance between A and B.**

Distance between A and B = Speed x Time = 90 mph x 1.77 hours = 176.5 miles

**The answer is:** B

The distance between A and B is 90 miles.

**Note:** The answer is B because the distance between A and B is 90 miles, and the time spent driving to B is 1 hour, which is equal to 1 hour. Therefore, the distance between A and B is 90 miles.

Instruction: Car ‘X’ covers a distance of 320 kms in 8 hours and car ‘Y’ covers a distance of 415 kms in 5 hrs. What is the difference in the speed of the two cars? options: A)42kms/hr, B)41km/hr, C)43kms/hr, D)45kms/hr, E)None of these
Output: 

The formula for speed is given by the formula:

Speed = Distance/Time

where Speed is the speed of a car, Distance is the distance covered by the car, and Time is the time taken to cover the distance.

For car ‘X’, the speed is 320/8 = 40 km/hr
For car ‘Y’, the speed is 415/5 = 71 km/hr

The difference in speed is 40-71 = -29 km/hr

Output: 

The given function [x] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x. Let's call this function L(x,y).

L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y]

Now, we need to find the number of pairs of positive real numbers (x,y) for which options A)L(x,y) = R(x,y) is true.

To do this, we need to find the number of pairs of positive real numbers (x,y) for which options B)L(x,y) ≠ R(x,y) is true.

The number of pairs of positive real numbers (x,y) for which options B)L(x,y) ≠ R(x,y) is given by the formula:

n(x,y) = n(x) + n(y) - n(x,y)

where n(x,y) is the number of pairs of positive real numbers (x,y) for which options B)L(x,y) ≠ R(x,y) is true.

**Explanation:**

Given the information, we know that x<0, y>0, and |x^3| > |y^2|.

**Step 1:**

If x<0, then y>0.

**Step 2:**

If y^2 > x^2, then |x^3| > |y^2|.

**Step 3:**

If x^3 < y^2, then |x^3| < |y^2|.

**Step 4:**

If x<0, then y>0.

**The answer is:**

D

The answer is: D) - x < y.

This is because if x<0, then y>0, and if |x^3| > |y^2|, then |x^3| < |y^2|. Therefore, if x<0, then y>0, and if |x^3| > |y^2|, then |x^3| < |y^2|.

Output: Volume of Big Cube considering it is not hollow = L3 = 5*5*5 = 125 cm3
Size of hollow cube (considering 1 cm thickness on two faces of large cube = 5 - 2 = 3cm
Volume of hollow cube = 3*3*3 = 27 cm3
So Total Volume filled up by smaller cubes = Volume of Larger Cube - Volume of hollow cube

Volume of 1 small cube = 1*1*1 = 1 cm3
Total number of small cubes in the larger cube = 98 / 1 = 98
and Number of faces of 98 small cubes (6 faces each cube has) = 98*6 = 588 faces
Total Surface area of 6 faces of larger cube painted = 6*L2 = 6*5*5 = 150cm2
Surface area of one face of small cube = 1*1 = 1cm2
Number of faces of small cube painted = 150/1 = 150 faces
Hence number of faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted= 588-150

Output: 

Jack bought 18 sharpeners for Rs. 100. If he pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown sharpeners, then the number of white sharpeners he bought is:

Number of white sharpeners = 18 - 2 = 16

The number of brown sharpeners he bought is:

Number of brown sharpeners = 18 - 16 = 2

Instruction: A shopkeeper employed a servant at a monthly salary of 1500. In addition to it, he agreed to pay him a commission of 15% on the monthly sale. How much sale in Rupees should the servant do if he wants his monthly income as 6000? options: A)30000, B)415000, C)31500, D)50000, E)None of these
Output: 

The shopkeeper employed a servant at a monthly salary of 1500. In addition to it, he agreed to pay him a commission of 15% on the monthly sale. So, the total monthly income of the servant will be 1500 + 15% of the monthly sale.

To find out the monthly sale, we need to divide the total monthly income by the commission rate.

The monthly sale will be 6000 / 15% = 4000.

Therefore, the servant should do 4000 of the sale to earn his monthly income of 6000.

Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy. During a month, both of them makes 35 toys in total. If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob? options: A)15, B)16, C)17, D)18, E)19
Output: Lets say Alex has worked for x hrs., and Jacob has worked for y hrs. So, number of toys prepared by Alex is x/7, and Jacob is y/9. Since total number of toys prepared by both of them is 35.
=> x/7 + y/9 = 35.
=> 9x + 7y = (35)(63)
=> 7y = (35)(63) - 9x
=> y = (5)(63) - (9/7)x
=> y = 315 - (9/7)x
=> x is to be a multiple of 7. Also, we need to minimize the difference between x & y. Here are some possible values,
x = 126, y = 315 - (9/7)126 = 153
x = 133, y = 315 - (9/7)133 = 144
x = 140, y = 315 - (9/7)140 = 135
x = 147, y = 315 - (9/7)147 = 126
As we can see minimum difference between x and y is when x is 140 hrs. and y is 135 hrs. Thus total toys created by Jacob = y/9 = 135/9 = 15.

Instruction: A newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week. If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week and pays $210 per week for newspapers, how many newspapers does it buy on Monday? options: A)15, B)30, C)45, D)60, E)75
Output: 

The newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week. If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week, then it will buy twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week. Therefore, the number of newspapers bought on Sunday is 2x, where x is the number of newspapers bought on the rest of the days of the week.

The total number of newspapers bought on the rest of the days of the week is x.

The total number of newspapers bought on Sunday is 2x.

The total number of newspapers bought is 2x + x = 3x.

The total number of newspapers bought is $210 per week.

Therefore, 3x = $210.

x = $210/3 = $70

Instruction: Three bells ring at intervals of 36 seconds, 40 seconds and 48 seconds, respectively. They start ringing together at a particular time. When they will ring together again? options: A)After 6 minutes, B)After 12 minutes, C)After 18 minutes, D)After 24 minutes, E)none
Output: 

The bells ring at intervals of 36 seconds, 40 seconds and 48 seconds, respectively. They start ringing together at a particular time. When they will ring together again?

The time at which the bells will ring together again is directly proportional to the number of intervals between the two bells.

If the time between the two bells is 36 seconds, then the number of intervals between the two bells is 36 seconds.

If the time between the two bells is 40 seconds, then the number of intervals between the two bells is 40 seconds.

If the time between the two bells is 48 seconds, then the number of intervals between the two bells is 48 seconds.

Therefore, the time at which the bells will ring together again is the time at which the number of intervals between the two bells is equal to the number of intervals between the two bells.

The number of intervals between the two bells is 36 seconds, so the time at which the bells will ring together again is 36 seconds.

The answer is: A)After 6 minutes

This is because the time at which the bells will ring together again is directly proportional to the number of intervals between the two bells. If the time between the two bells is 36 seconds, then the number of intervals between the two bells is 36 seconds. Therefore, the time at which the bells will ring together again is the time at which the number of intervals between the two bells is equal to the number of","Instruction: 5 horses are in a race.

Output: Volume of Big Cube considering it is not hollow = L3 = 5*5*5 = 125 cm3
Size of hollow cube (considering 1 cm thickness on two faces of large cube = 5 - 2 = 3cm
Volume of hollow cube = 3*3*3 = 27 cm3
So Total Volume filled up by smaller cubes = Volume of Larger Cube - Volume of hollow cube
= 125 - 27
= 98 cm3
Volume of 1 small cube = 1*1*1 = 1 cm3
Total number of small cubes in the larger cube = 98 / 1 = 98
and Number of faces of 98 small cubes (6 faces each cube has) = 98*6 = 588 faces
Total Surface area of 6 faces of larger cube painted = 6*L2 = 6*5*5 = 150cm2
Surface area of one face of small cube = 1*1 = 1cm2
Number of faces of small cube painted = 150/1 = 150 faces
Hence number of faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted= 588-150
= 438

Instruction: 10kg of a mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay. In order to make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand how much of the mixture is to be removed and replaced with pure sand? options: A)10/7, B)20/7, C)30/7, D)40/7, E)50/7
Output: 

The mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay. To make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand, the amount of sand and clay to be removed and replaced is equal to the difference between the percentage of sand and the percentage of clay in the mixture.

Therefore, the amount of sand to be removed and replaced = 30% - 30% = 0%

The amount of clay to be removed and replaced = 70% - 30% = 40%

The total amount of mixture to be removed and replaced = 0% + 40% = 40%

The amount of mixture to be replaced = 10kg * 40% = 4kg

Instruction: Jerry purchased a 1-year $5,000 bond that paid an annual interest rate of 12% compounded every six months. How much interest had this bond accrued at maturity? options: A)$5102, B)$618, C)$216, D)$202, E)$200
Output: 

The formula for compound interest is given by the formula:

A = Pe(r/n)n^(n*t)

where A is the future value, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the number of years.

Given values:
P = $5,000
r = 12%
n = 6
t = 1

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

A = 5000(1.12/6)6

A = $5102

Therefore, the interest accrued at maturity is $5102 - $5000 = $102.

Output: Explanation:
Suppose the merchant will take advantage of the cash discount of 4% of $20 000 = $800 by paying the bill within 30 days from the date of invoice. He needs to borrow $20 000 = $800 = $19 200. He would borrow this money on day 30 and repay it on day 100 (the day the original invoice is due) resulting in a 70-day loan. The interest he should be willing to pay on borrowed money should not exceed the cash discount $800.
r=I/pt=21.73%
The highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money is 21.73%. This is a break-even rate. If he can borrow money, say at a rate of 15%, he should do so. He would borrow $19 200 for 70 days at 15%. Maturity value of the loan is $19 200(1+0.15(70/365))=$19 752.33
savings would be $20 000 − $19 752.33 = $247.67

Instruction: In the coordinate plane, a triangle has vertices at (a,0), (b,0), and (x,y). If a>x>b>0>y, which of the following represents the area of that triangle? options: A)(ay−by)/2, B)(ab−ay)/2, C)(by−ay)/2, D)(ay+by)/x, E)(a−b)/2y
Output: 
The area of a triangle is given by the formula A = 1/2(a*b*h), where A is the area, a, b, and h are the lengths of the sides of the triangle.

Given the information, we know that a>x>b>0>y. Therefore, we can substitute a>x>b>0>y into the formula for the area of a triangle.

A = 1/2(a*b*h) = 1/2(a*b*h) = 1/2(a*b*h) = 1/2(a*b*h) = 1/2(a*b*h) = 1/2(a*b*h) = 1/2(a*b*h) = 1/2(a*b*h) = 1/2(a*b*h) = 1/2(a*b*h) = 1/2(a*b*h) = 1/2(a*b*h) = 1/2(a*b*h) = 1/2(a*b*h) = 1/2(a*b*h) = 1/2(a*b*h) = 1/2(a*b*h) = 1/2(a*b*h) = 1/2(a*b*h)","Instruction: A merchant receives an invoice for a motor boat for $20 000 with terms 4/30, n/100.

Output: 

The formula for the volume of a rectangular solid is given by the formula V = lwh, where V is the volume, l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.

Given the dimensions of the solid are 3 x 4 x 15, we can find the volume as follows:

V = 3 x 4 x 15 = 180 cubic units

The formula for the surface area of a sphere is given by the formula A = 4πr^2, where A is the surface area, π is the constant for the area of a circle, and r is the radius of the sphere.

Since the volume of the solid is 180 cubic units, we can find the radius of the sphere as follows:

V = lwh = 180 cubic units
l = 3 units
w = 4 units
h = 15 units

r = √(lwh) = √(3 x 4 x 15) = 3√5 units

The diameter of the sphere is given by the formula D = 2r, where D is the diameter, r is the radius of the sphere.

D = 2r = 2(3√5) = 6√5 units

Output: 

The coin will be flipped twenty times and each time it lands on heads, Christopher will give $2 to Jonathan and each time it lands on tails, Jonathan will give 3$ to Christopher. Therefore, the probability of landing on heads is 1/2 and the probability of landing on tails is also 1/2.

The probability of landing on heads is 1/2 and the probability of landing on tails is also 1/2. Therefore, the probability of landing on heads and tails is 1/2.

The coin will land on heads and tails with the same probability. Therefore, the number of times the coin landed on heads is equal to the number of times the coin landed on tails.

The number of times the coin landed on heads is 20.

Instruction: A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth? options: A)56, B)58, C)60, D)62, E)64
Output: 

The area of a square is given by the formula A = s^2, where A is the area, s is the side length.

If the area of a square is 70 square feet, then the side length of the square is s = √(70) = 7 feet.

The square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge, so the new side length of the square piece is s - 4 = 6 feet.

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = l*w, where A is the area, l is the length, and w is the width.

If the area of a rectangle is 70 square feet, then the length and width of the rectangle are l = 7 feet and w = 7 feet.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2l + 2w, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

If the perimeter of the rectangle is 70 feet, then the length and width of the rectangle are l = 7 feet and w = 7 feet.

Instruction: A box contains a certain number of balls, marked successively from 1 to n. If there are 45 different ways that two balls can be selected from the box such that the ball with number 3 marked on it is not selected, then what is the value of n? options: A)11, B)10, C)9, D)8, E)7
Output: 

The number of ways to select two balls from a box containing n balls, where the ball with number 3 marked on it is not selected, is given by the formula:

C(n, 2) = C(n, 1) + C(n, 2) - C(n, 3)

where C(n, k) is the number of ways to select k balls from a box containing n balls.

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:

45 = C(n, 1) + C(n, 2) - C(n, 3)

45 = C(n, 1) + C(n, 2) - C(n, 4)

45 = C(n, 1) + C(n, 2) - C(n, 5)

45 = C(n, 1) + C(n, 2) - C(n, 6)

45 = C(n, 1) + C(n, 2) - C(n, 7)

45 = C(n, 1) + C(n, 2) - C(n, 8)

45 = C(n, 1) + C(n, 2) - C(n, 9)

45 = C(n, 1) + C(n, 2) - C(n, 10)

The answer is: C)","Instruction: A pen company produces very fine quality of writing pens. Company knows that on average 10% of the produced pens are always defective so are rejected before packing. Company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. It estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. What is the manufactured cost of each pen? options: A)Rs. 6, B)Rs. 7.2, C)Rs. 5.6, D)Rs. 8, E)None of these
Output: The company is able to deliver 90% of the manufactured pens. Means to produce 7200 pens they must have to produce 8000 pens as 10% are defectives. So, let K be the manufacturing price of each pen.
Total income (including 25% profit) = 8000 *K *1.25
This same income is obtained by selling 90% manufactured pens at Rs. 10 which is equal to 7200 *10.
Thus,
8000 *K *1.25 = 7200 *10
K = Rs. 7.2. [90% of 8000 = 7200]

Instruction: The average wages of a worker during a fortnight comprising of 15 consecutive working days was $90 per day. During the first 7 days, his average wage was $87 per day and the average wage during the last 7 days was $92 per day. What was his wage on the 8th day? options: A)$83, B)$92, C)$90, D)$97, E)$104
Output: 

The average wages of a worker during a fortnight comprising of 15 consecutive working days was $90 per day. During the first 7 days, his average wage was $87 per day and the average wage during the last 7 days was $92 per day. So, the total wages earned during the first 7 days were $87 x 7 = $588.

The total wages earned during the last 7 days were $92 x 7 = $588.

Therefore, the total wages earned during the fortnight were $588 + $588 = $1188.

The wage on the 8th day was $1188 - $588 = $588.

Output: 

**Step 1:** Calculate the difference between the father's age and the sister's age.
Father's age - Sister's age = 32

**Step 2:** Add the difference to the father's age.
Father's age + 32 = 272

**Step 3:** Subtract the father's age from the sum.
Father's age - Father's age = 124

**Step 4:** Add the father's age to the sum.
Father's age + 124 = 176

**Step 5:** Subtract the father's age from the sum.
Father's age - Father's age = 0

**The answer is:** B) 2.25

The answer is: B) 2.25

This is because the father's age is equal to the sum of his age and the sister's age, which is equal to 272. When the father's age is equal to the sum of his age and the sister's age, the sister's age is equal to twice the father's age. Therefore, the sister's age is equal to 272 - 32 = 200. When the father's age is equal to the sum of his age and the sister's age, the father's age is equal to 272 + 32 = 304. When the father's age is equal to 304, the sister's age is equal to 200. Therefore, the answer is B) 2.25.

","Instruction: Joe's age, Joe's sister's age and Joe’s fathers age sums up to 100. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now.

After x years joe age is equal to his father
Joe+x = father
Therefore, Sister+x = 2 * Sister
=> Sister=x
Joe+Sister=Father
Therefore,
=> 2*Father = 100

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = l*w, where A is the area, l is the length, and w is the width.

We know that the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, and the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet. So, the length of the painted side is 37 - 9 = 28 feet.

The area of a rectangle is equal to the product of its length and width. Therefore, the area of the parking space is 28*9 = 252 square feet.

Therefore, the number of employees in that organization would be the number of employees whose total contribution is equal to Rs. 6.24 lakh.

To find the number of employees, we need to divide Rs. 6.24 lakh by Rs. 60.

Rs. 6.24 lakh / Rs. 60 = Rs. 1200

Instruction: What is the largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation x2 - 5x + k = 0 will have two real and distinct roots? options: A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12
Output: 

The quadratic equation is given by the formula:

x2 - 5x + k = 0

To find the roots, we need to find the values of 'k' that make the equation equal to zero.

To find the values of 'k', we can use the quadratic formula:

k = [x2 - 5x + 0] / 2

k = [x2 - 5x + 0] / 2

k = [x2 - 5x + 0] / 2

k = [x2 - 5x + 0] / 2

k = [x2 - 5x + 0] / 2

k = [x2 - 5x + 0] / 2

k = [x2 - 5x + 0] / 2

k = [x2 - 5x + 0] / 2

k = [x2 - 5x + 0] / 2

k = [x2 - 5x + 0] / 2

k = [x2 - 5x + 0] / 2

k = [x2 - 5x + 0] / 2

k = [x2 - 5x + 0] / 2

k = [x2 - 5x + 0] / 2

k = [x2 - 5x + 0] / 2

k = [x2","Instruction: A club consists of members whose ages are in A.P. The common difference being 3 months. If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then number of members in the club are : options: A)18, B)20, C)25, D)26, E)27

Output: 

The formula for simple interest is given by the formula I = P*R*T, where I is the interest, P is the principal, R is the rate of interest, and T is the time period.

Given values:
P = Rs.360
R = Unknown
T = 12

We know that the simple interest is equal to the principal multiplied by the rate of interest multiplied by the time period. So, we can write:

I = 360*R*12

To find the rate of interest, we need to isolate R on one side of the equation. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 12:

R = 360*12/12

R = 30

Output: 

Neha's position in the row is 12th from left end and Radha's position in the row is 6th from right end. When Radha is shifted to left by 2 places, Neha's position becomes 12th - 2 = 10th from left end. When Neha is shifted to right by 2 places, Radha's position becomes 6th + 2 = 8th from right end.

The number of children between Radha and Neha is 8 - 12 = -4.

Since the number of children between Radha and Neha is negative, it means that there are no children between Radha and Neha.

Output: 

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = l * w, where A is the area, l is the length, and w is the width.

We know that the area of the yard is 240 square meters, and that the yard has an area of 240 square meters. So, we can write:

240 = l * w

We also know that the yard has an area of 10 meters, and that the other two sides of the yard have an area of 240 - 10 = 230 square meters. So, we can write:

l * w = 230

We can now solve for l and w:

l = 230 / w

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = l * w, where A is the area, l is the length, and w is the width.

We know that the area of the yard is 240 square meters, and that the yard has an area of 240 square meters. So, we can write:

240 = l * w

We also know that the yard has an area of 10 meters, and that the other two sides of the yard have an area of 240 - 10 = 230 square meters. So, we can write:

Output: 

The merchant receives an invoice for a motor boat for $20 000 with terms 4/30, n/100. The formula for simple interest is given by the formula I = P * r * t, where I is the simple interest, P is the principal, r is the rate of interest, and t is the time period.

We know that the principal is $20 000, the rate of interest is 4/30, and the time period is 30 years. So, we can substitute these values into the formula to get I = 20,000 * 4/30 * 30 = $16,666.66

Output: 

The company produces 10% defective pens, therefore the remaining 90% of pens are good. So, the number of good pens is 90% of 7200 = 6240 pens. The cost of each good pen is Rs. 6240/7200 = Rs. 0.8. The profit on each good pen is Rs. 0.8 x 10% = Rs. 0.08. Therefore, the cost of each good pen is Rs. 0.8 - Rs. 0.08 = Rs. 0.76.

Output: The cost of adding one soda and one energy bar is 150 cents. We need to purchase six sodas and seven bars. We know two sodas and three bars costs 300 cents, so to that purchase, we'd need to add four sodas and four bars - or four sets of items. So, we take the initial 300 + (4 * 150) = 300+600 = 900.

Instruction: A student instead of finding the value of 7/8 of a number, found the value of 7/18 of the number. If his answer differed from the actual one by 770, find the that number. options: A)1584, B)2520, C)1728, D)1656, E)None
Output: 

The value of 7/8 of a number is equal to the number multiplied by 7/8. If the answer is different from the actual one by 770, then the number must be greater than 770.

To find the number, we need to first find the value of 7/8 of the number. To do this, we multiply the number by 7/8.

Once we have the value of 7/8 of the number, we can find the actual answer by subtracting 770 from the value of 7/8 of the number.

The actual answer is 1584.

Instruction: If one of the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 + mx + 22 = 0 is 1.5, then what is the value of m? options: A)-23.5, B)-17.5, C)-10.5, D)-16.2, E)Cannot be determined
Output: 

The quadratic equation is given by the formula x^2 + mx + 22 = 0. We know that the root of the equation is 1.5, so we can substitute this value into the formula as 1.5x^2 + mx + 22 = 0.

To find the value of m, we need to find the value of m that makes the equation true. We can do this by finding the factors of 22 that are multiples of 1.5. The factors of 22 that are multiples of 1.5 are 1, 3, 5, 6, and 9.

The factors of m that are multiples of 1.5 are 1, 3, 5, and 6.

Therefore, the value of m is 1, 3, 5, 6, or 9.

The answer is: B

The average speed is given by the formula average speed = total distance/total time. We know that the total distance is 5*6 + 4*12 = 36 km and the total time is 6 + 12 = 18 hours. So, the average speed is 36/18 = 2 km/h.

Instruction: A father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan who are 23 and 24 at present. He divides the amount in such a way that if their shares are invested at compound interest at 4% p.a. they will receive equal amount on attaining the age of 26 years. Find Mohan's share. options: A)2400, B)2500, C)2600, D)2700, E)None of these
Output: 

The formula for compound interest is given by the formula A = Pe(1 + r/n)n, where A is the future value, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year, and t is the number of years.

Given information:
P = Rs. 5100
r = 4%
n = 1
t = 26

We need to find the value of P that will give equal shares to Mohan and Sohan at the age of 26.

To find the value of P, we need to find the value of r that will give equal shares to Mohan and Sohan at the age of 26.

r = 4%

To find the value of P, we need to find the value of n that will give equal shares to Mohan and Sohan at the age of 26.

n = 1

Now, we can substitute the values of r and n into the formula for compound interest to find the value of P.

A = Pe(1 + 0.04/1)1

A = Rs. 5100

Therefore, the value of P that will give equal shares to Mohan and Sohan at the age of 26 is Rs. 5100.

Output: 

The question is asking for the number of additional gallons of orange juice that must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink.

To find out the number of gallons of orange juice that must be mixed, we need to first calculate the amount of orange juice in the soft drink.

If the soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, then the amount of orange juice in the soft drink is 40% of the total volume of the soft drink.

To find out the total volume of the soft drink, we need to divide the amount of orange juice in the soft drink by the percentage of orange juice in the soft drink.

If the amount of orange juice in the soft drink is A gallons, then the total volume of the soft drink is A/0.4.

To make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink, we need to add A/0.4 gallons of orange juice to the soft drink.

Therefore, the number of additional gallons of orange juice that must be mixed is A/0.4.

Output: 

The time taken by ball A to complete one rotation is 26 minutes. So, the number of rotations ball A can complete in 26 minutes is 26/2 = 13 rotations.

The time taken by ball B to complete one rotation is 35 minutes. So, the number of rotations ball B can complete in 35 minutes is 35/5 = 7 rotations.

If they start rotating now from the same point, the number of rotations ball A will complete in 26 minutes is 13 rotations. Therefore, the number of rotations ball B will complete in 26 minutes is 13 rotations.

The reason for this is that if 3 men drop out, then there will be 2 men remaining to purchase the gift. In order to split the cost equally, each man will have to contribute D/2.

Therefore, the total cost of the gift will be D/2. If 3 men drop out, then the cost of the gift will be reduced by D/3. So, the remaining cost of the gift will be D/2 - D/3 = D/6.
