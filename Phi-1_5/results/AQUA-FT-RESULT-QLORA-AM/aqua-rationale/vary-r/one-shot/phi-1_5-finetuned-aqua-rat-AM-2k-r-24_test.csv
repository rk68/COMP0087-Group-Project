Output: 
Let the weight of the coin be x grams.
Then, the volume of aluminum in the alloy is (2/3)x grams.
The volume of silver in the alloy is (1/3)x grams.
The weight of the coin is 30 grams.
(2/3)x = 30
x = 45
The weight of the coin is 45 grams.
The weight of the coin measuring 1 x 30 mm is (1/3)x = (1/3) x 45 = 15 grams.

Area of the circle = (20*20*π)/4 = 20π
Area of the remaining paper = 400 - 20π = 400 - 20π
Area of the remaining paper = 400 - 20π = 400 - 20π
Area of the remaining paper = 400 - 20π = 400 - 20π
Area of the remaining paper = 400 - 20π = 400 - 20π
Area of the remaining paper = 400 - 20π = 400 - 20π
Area of the remaining paper = 400 - 20π = 400 - 20π

Output: 
Let the original retail price be x.
Then, the wholesale price is (x-60)/100 = x-120/100 = x-60
The selling price is (x-60)-20 = x-80
The selling price is 20% more than the wholesale price.
x-60 = x-80 + 20% of x
x-60 = x-80 + 0.2x
x-60 = 0.8x

Output: 
Let the smaller number be 3x.
Then the larger number is 5x.
If 9 is subtracted from each, the new numbers are (3x-9) and (5x-9).
The new numbers are in the ratio 12:23.
So, (3x-9)/(5x-9) = 12/23
3x-9 = 12x-15
3x = 15
x = 5
So, the smaller number is 3x = 3*5 = 15.

Explanation:
The probability that Mr.Jain selected the winning horse is 1/5.
The probability that he selected the losing horse is 4/5.
The probability that he selected the winning horse and the losing horse is 1/5 x 4/5 = 4/25.
The probability that he selected the winning horse and the losing horse is 1/5 x 4/25 = 4/25.
The probability that he selected the winning horse and the winning horse is 1/5 x 4/25 = 4/25.
The probability that he selected the winning horse and the losing horse is 1/5 x 4/25 = 4/25.
The probability that he selected the winning horse and the winning horse is 1/5 x 4/25 = 4/25.
The probability that he selected the winning horse and the losing horse is 1/5 x 4/25 = 4/25.
The probability that he selected the winning horse and the winning horse is 1/5 x 4/25 = 4/25.
The probability that he selected the winning horse and the losing horse is 1/5 x 4/25 = 4/25.

Instruction: 64 boys and 40 girls form a group for social work. During their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. How many members does the group have now, if the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3? options: A)277, B)288, C)200, D)277, E)168
Output: 
Let the number of boys be 4x and the number of girls be 3x.
Then, the total number of members is 4x + 3x = 7x.
Given that the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, we can write:
4x/3x = 4/3
x = 12
So, the total number of members is 7x = 7(12) = 84.

Output: 
Let x be the minimum selling price per component.
The revenue from sales is 420x.
The production cost is 110x.
The profit is 420x - 110x = 260x.
The minimum profit is at least $626,400, so 260x ≥ 626,400.
x ≥ 626,400/260 = $230.

The total amount of money is Rs 8600.
So, x + 4x + 5x = Rs 8600
9x = Rs 8600
x = Rs 800
Answer: E
E.g.
Let the amount of money each nephew receives be x.
Then, the amount of money each daughter receives is 4x.
And, the amount of money each son receives is 5x.
The total amount of money is Rs 8600.
So, x + 4x + 5x = Rs 8600
9x = Rs 8600
x = Rs 800

Output: 
Let the speed of the ship be x miles per hour.
Then, the speed of the plane is 10x miles per hour.
The distance traveled by the ship is 180 miles.
The distance traveled by the plane is 10x * 180 = 1800 miles.
The distance between the ship and the plane is the total distance traveled by the ship and the plane.
So, the distance between the ship and the plane is 180 + 1800 = 2160 miles.
The time taken by the ship to travel 2160 miles is 2160/x hours.
The time taken by the plane to travel 2160 miles is 1800/10x hours.
The time taken by the ship and the plane to meet is 2160/x + 1800/10x = 2160/x + 180/x = 2160/x + 3/x = 2160/x + 3/x = 2160/x + 3/x = 2160/x + 3/x = 2160/x + 3/x = 2160/x + 3/x = 2160/x + 3/x = 2160/x + 3/x = 2160/x + 3/x = 2160/","Instruction: A father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan who are 23 and 24 at present.

Output: 
Let the number of passing students be x and the number of failing students be y.
Then, x + y = 50
x + (50 - x) = 83
x = 16
y = 34
Total number of students = x + y = 50 + 34 = 84
Total class average = (x + y)/84 = (16 + 34)/84 = 50
Percent of class that passed = (x/84) * 100 = (16/84) * 100 = 22.22%

Let the total number of students be x.
Then, 8% of x are interested in football, 4/5 of x are interested in cricket, 10% of x are interested in basketball and remaining 20 students are not interested in any games.
So, (8/100)x + (4/5)x + (10/100)x + 20 = x
(8/100)x + (4/5)x + (10/100)x = (20/100)x
(8/100)x + (4/5)x + (10/100)x = (20/100)x

How many different codes can be made? options: A)1,980, B)2,020, C)2,100, D)2,200, E)1,900
Output: 
Let the number of consonants be x.
Then the number of vowels is 20 - x.
The number of codes is given by the following formula:
(20 - x)(20 - x)(20 - x) = x(20 - x)(20 - x)(20 - x)
= x^5 - x^4 - x^3 - x^2 - x - 1
= x^5 - x^4 - x^3 - x^2 - x - 1
= x^5 - x^4 - x^3 - x^2 - x - 1
= x^5 - x^4 - x^3 - x^2 - x - 1
= x^5 - x^4 - x^3 - x^2 - x - 1
= x^5 - x^4 - x^3 - x^2 - x - 1
= x^5 - x^4 - x^3 - x^2 - x - 1
= x^5 - x^4 - x^3 - x^2 - x - 1

Instruction: X and Y are two alloys which were made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9 and 7:11, respectively.

Output: 
Let the ratio of zinc to copper in the alloy be 6x:9x and 7x:11x.
Then, the weight of the alloy is 6x + 9x + 7x = 20x.
Given that the weight of the alloy is 40 grams, we have 20x = 40.
Solving for x, we get x = 2.
Therefore, the ratio of zinc to copper in the alloy is 6x:9x = 6:9 = 2:3.

Answer: E

Explanation:
Let the number of members in the family be x.
Total income of the family = $9000
Median income = $3000
Total income of all members = $9000 + $3000 = $12000
x * $3000 = $12000
x = $12000 / $3000 = 4

Instruction: The height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. The height of the room is: options: A)2.6m, B)3.9m, C)4m, D)4.2m, E)4.4m
Output: 
Let the height of the room be x.
Then, the width of the room is (2x+5)/2.
The area of the room is (2x+5)(x+5) = 15.
The cost of paper is (2x+5)(x+5) = 2x^2 + 5x + 25.
The cost of paper for the walls is (2x+5)(x+5) = 2x^2 + 5x + 25.
The cost of paper for the doors and windows is (15-2x-5)/2 = (x-5).
The total cost of paper is 2x^2 + 5x + 25 + x - 5 = 2x^2 + 4x + 20.
The cost of paper for the walls is (2x+5)(x+5) = 2x^2 + 5x + 25.
The cost of paper for the doors and windows is (15-2x-5)/2 = (x-5).
The total cost of paper is 2x^2 + 4x + 20 + x - 5 = 2x^2 + 4x + 15.

Output: 
Let the breadth of the piece be x.
Then, the length of the piece is 4x + 1.
The perimeter of the piece is 2(x + 4x + 1) = 2(5x + 1) = 10x + 2.
The minimum perimeter is 10x + 2 = 6x + 2.
The minimum perimeter is 6x + 2 = 6x + 2.
The minimum perimeter is 6x + 2 = 6x + 2.
The minimum perimeter is 6x + 2 = 6x + 2.
The minimum perimeter is 6x + 2 = 6x + 2.
The minimum perimeter is 6x + 2 = 6x + 2.
The minimum perimeter is 6x + 2 = 6x + 2.
The minimum perimeter is 6x + 2 = 6x + 2.
The minimum perimeter is 6x + 2 = 6x + 2.
The minimum perimeter is 6x + 2 = 6x + 2.
The minimum perimeter is 6x + 2 = 6x + 2.

Instruction: A jeep travels a certain distance taking 6 hours in the forward journey. During the return journey, it increased its speed by 12km/hr and took 4 hours. What is the distance travelled by the jeep? options: A)126km, B)144km, C)127km, D)228km, E)128km
Output: 
Let the distance travelled by the jeep be x km.
Then, the time taken by the jeep to travel x km in the forward journey is 6 hours.
The time taken by the jeep to travel x km in the return journey is 4 hours.
The speed of the jeep in the forward journey is 55 km/hr.
The speed of the jeep in the return journey is (55+12) km/hr = 67 km/hr.
Therefore, x = (6*55 + 4*67)/(6+4) = 127 km.

Output: 
Let the number of matches that the team lost be x.
Then, the number of matches that the team won is 20 - x.
The percentage of matches that the team lost is 30%.
So, (30/100) * (20 - x) = 30
Solving for x, we get x = 10.

What is the final concentration of tea John drinks? options: A)15.38%, B)42%, C)39.86%, D)22.35%, E)32.51%
Output: 
Let the concentration of tea be x.
Then, the concentration of milk is (1-15/100)x = (85/100)x
Let the concentration of milk after replacement be (1-10/100)(85/100)x = (85/100)(9/10)x = (85/10)x
The final concentration of tea is x + (85/10)x = (85/10)x + (85/10)x = (85/10)x + (85/10)x = (85/10)x + (85/10)x = (85/10)x + (85/10)x = (85/10)x + (85/10)x = (85/10)x + (85/10)x = (85/10)x + (85/10)x = (85/10)x + (85/10)x = (85/10)x + (85/10)x = (85/10)x + (85/10)x = (85/10)x + (85/10)x = (85/10)x + (85","Instruction: A retailer sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00.
