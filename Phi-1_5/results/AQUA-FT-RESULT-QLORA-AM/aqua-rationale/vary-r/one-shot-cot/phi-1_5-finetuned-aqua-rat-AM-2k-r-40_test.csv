Instruction: All 250 files on Sam's hard drive are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm? options: A)50, B)70, C)75, D)100, E)125
Output: 
Let the number of files infected by a virus be x.
Then the number of files infected by a worm is 2.5x.
The total number of files is 250.
So, x + 2.5x = 250
3.5x = 250
x = 71.43
So, the number of files infected by a virus is 71.
The number of files infected by a worm is 2.5x = 2.5 * 71 = 175.
The total number of files infected by a virus and a worm is 71 + 175 = 306.
The number of files NOT infected by a virus is 250 - 306 = -16.

The smaller number is?","['A)21', 'B)33', 'C)35', 'D)42', 'E)58']",B,"Instruction: Two balls A and B rotate along a circular track. Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes. Ball B makes 5 full rotation in 35 minutes. If they start rotating now from the same point, when will they be at the same starting point again? options: A)1 hour and 31 minutes, B)2 hour and 31 minutes, C)3 hour and 31 minutes, D)4 hour and 31 minutes, E)5 hour and 31 minutes
Output: If ball A makes 2 rotations in 26 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 13 minutes. If ball B makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 7 minutes.
The two balls start rotating now and makes several rotations before they are at the SAME starting points. Ball A would have done a WHOLE number X of rotations and ball B would have done a WHOLE number Y of rotations. Also they would have rotated during the same period of time T. Hence
T = 13 X = 7 Y
Hence 13 X = 7 Y
Solve the above for X
X = 7 Y / 13
We want the time when they are FIRST at the same starting point. Therefore X and Y are the smallest whole numbers of the equation X = 7 Y / 13. The smallest value of Y that gives X as a whole number is 13. Hence
X = 7 (13) / 13 = 7
Time T is given by
T = 13 X = 13 * 7 = 91 minutes = 1 hour and 31 minutes

Output: 
Let the smaller number be 3x.
Then the larger number is 5x.
(3x - 9) : (5x - 9) = 12 : 23
3x - 9 = 12
3x = 21
x = 7
The smaller number is 3x = 21.

Instruction: A man can paint a house in 10 days. A woman can paint the same house in 15 days. How long will it take them to paint the house if they work together? options: A)5 days, B)7 days, C)10 days, D)12 days, E)15 days
Output:
Let the work done by the man in 1 day be M.
Let the work done by the woman in 1 day be W.
Then,
M + W = 1
M = 1 - W
(1 - W) + W = 1
W = 1
The work done by the woman in 1 day is W = 1.
The work done by the man in 1 day is M = 1 - W = 1 - 1 = 0.
The work done by the man and the woman in 1 day is 0 + 1 = 1.
The work done by the man and the woman in 10 days is 10 * 1 = 10.

","Instruction: When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Find the area of the sheet. options: A)1584, B)1120, C)792, D)1320, E)1200
Output: Let the sheet be folded along its breadth and its perimeter = 48cm
Therefore, (l/2 + b) = 48 ... (i)
Now, let the sheet be folded along its length, and the perimeter = 66cm
(l + b/2)= 66 …... (ii)
Solving (i) and (ii), we get,
l = 56cm, b = 20cm
Area = l*b
Area = 1120 cm2

Output: 
Minimum daily requirement of vitamin E = 9% of minimum daily requirement of vitamin E
Minimum daily requirement of vitamin A = 8% of minimum daily requirement of vitamin A
Total daily requirement of vitamin E = 9% of minimum daily requirement of vitamin E
Total daily requirement of vitamin A = 8% of minimum daily requirement of vitamin A
Total daily requirement of vitamin E and A = 9% of minimum daily requirement of vitamin E + 8% of minimum daily requirement of vitamin A
Total daily requirement of vitamin E and A = 9% of minimum daily requirement of vitamin E + 8% of minimum daily requirement of vitamin A
Total daily requirement of vitamin E and A = 9% of minimum daily requirement of vitamin E + 8% of minimum daily requirement of vitamin A
Total daily requirement of vitamin E and A = 9% of minimum daily requirement of vitamin E + 8% of minimum daily requirement of vitamin A

Instruction: In a class, 8% of total students are interested in Football. 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket. 10% of total students are interested in Basketball and remaining 20 students are not interested in any games. How many students are there in the class? options: A)850, B)800, C)900, D)950, E)1000
Output: 
Let the total number of students be x.
Then, 8% of x = x*8/100 = x/10
4/5 of x = x*4/5 = x/5
10% of x = x*10/100 = x/10
Remaining students = x - (x/10) - (x/5) - (x/10) = x - x/2 - x/5 - x/10 = x/2
x/2 = x/10 + x/5 + x/10 + x/2 = x/2 + x/5 + x/10 + x/2 = x/2 + x/5 + x/10 + x/2 = x/2 + x/5 + x/10 + x/2 = x/2 + x/5 + x/10 + x/2 = x/2 + x/5 + x/10 + x/2 = x/2 + x/5 + x/10 + x/2 = x/2 + x/5 + x/10 + x/2 = x/2 + x/5 + x/10 + x/2 = x/2 + x/5 + x/10 + x/2 = x/2 + x/5 + x/10 + x/2 = x/2 + x/5 + x/10 + x/2 = x/2","Instruction: It takes a worker 9 minutes to drive from home to work at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour.

What is the final concentration of tea John drinks? options: A)15.38%, B)42%, C)39.86%, D)22.35%, E)32.51%
Output: 
Let the concentration of tea be T.
Then, the concentration of milk is (1-15/100)*T = (85/100)*T
Then, the concentration of milk after replacement is (1-10/100)*(85/100)*T = (85/100)*(9/10)*T = (85/10)*T
So, the final concentration of tea John drinks is T+85/10*T = (85/10)*T+85/10*T = (85/10)*T+85/10*T = (85/10)*T
