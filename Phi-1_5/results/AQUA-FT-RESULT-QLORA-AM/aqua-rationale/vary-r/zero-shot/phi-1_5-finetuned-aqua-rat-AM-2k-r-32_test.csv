cents. If the costs of the items do not change, compute the cost in cents of six sodas and seven bars.","['A)500', 'B)600', 'C)750', 'D)800', 'E)900']",E,"Instruction: You can purchase one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents, or two sodas and three energy bars for 300
cents. If the costs of the items do not change, compute the cost in cents of six sodas and seven bars. options: A)500, B)600, C)750, D)800, E)900
Output: 
Let the cost of one soda be x cents and the cost of one energy bar be y cents.
Then,
x + 2y = 150
x + 3y = 300
Solving these equations, we get x = 50 cents and y = 75 cents.
The cost of six sodas and seven bars is 6(50) + 7(75) = 900 cents.

Output: 
Let the weight of the coin be x grams.
Then, the volume of aluminum in the alloy = 2x/15 = x/7.
The volume of silver in the alloy = 2x/15 = x/7.
The weight of the coin = x/7 + x/15 = x/15 + x/7 = (15x + 7x)/105 = (22x)/105 = x/21.
The weight of the coin measuring 1 x 30 mm = (1x/21) + 30 = x/21 + 210 = (21x + 210)/21 = x/21 + 210 = x/21 + 210 = x/21 + 210 = x/21 + 210 = x/21 + 210 = x/21 + 210 = x/21 + 210 = x/21 + 210 = x/21 + 210 = x/21 + 210 = x/21 + 210 = x/21 + 210 = x/21 + 210 = x/21 + 210 = x/21 + 210 = x/21 + 210 = x/21 + 210 = x/21 + 210 = x/21 + 210 = x/21 + 210 = x/21 +"

"All 250 files on Sam's hard drive are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm?","['A)50', 'B)70', 'C)75', 'D)100', 'E)125']",C,"Instruction: All 250 files on Sam's hard drive are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm? options: A)50, B)70, C)75, D)100, E)125
Output: 
Let the number of files infected by a virus be x.
Then the number of files infected by a worm is 2.5x.
The total number of files is 250, so we have:
x + 2.5x = 250
3.5x = 250
x = 71.43
Since the number of files infected by a virus must be a whole number, we can round up to 72.
The number of files infected by both a virus and a worm is 2.5x, so we have:
2.5x = 2.5(72) = 180
The number of files infected by only a worm is 2.5x, so we have:
2.5x = 2.5(72) = 180
The number of files infected by only a virus is 50% of 250, so we have:
50% of 250 = 0.5(250) = 125
The number of files infected by both a virus and a worm is 180, so we have:
180 - 125 = 55
The number of files infected by only a worm is 2.5x, so we have:
2.5x = 2.5(72)"

How many sales of $250 each must he make in order to reach a salary of at least $1000? options: A)15, B)24, C)25, D)40, E)52
Output: 
Let x be the number of sales of $250 each.
Then, the total commission earned is 10% of x, which is 0.1x.
The total salary is $1000.
So, we have the equation:
0.1x + 1000 = x
Solving for x, we get x = 4000.
Answer: D.
Explanation:
The total commission earned is 10% of x, which is 0.1x.
The total salary is $1000.
So, we have the equation:
0.1x + 1000 = x

If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost? options: A)20%, B)28%, C)36%, D)40%, E)42%
Output: 
Let the original retail price be x
Then, the wholesale price is (100-60)/100*x = 40/100*x
If the original retail price is sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then the selling price is (100-20)/100*x = 80/100*x
Selling price = 40/100*x
Selling price = (40/100)*x = (40/100)*x = 40/100*x = 40/100*x = 40/100*x = 40/100*x = 40/100*x = 40/100*x = 40/100*x = 40/100*x = 40/100*x = 40/100*x = 40/100*x = 40/100*x = 40/100*x = 40/100*x = 40/100*x = 40/100*x = 40/100*x = 40/100*x = 40/100*x = 40/100*x = 40/100*x = 40/100*x = 40/100*x = 40/100*x = 40/100*x = 40/100*x"

Output: 
Let the number of boys be 4x and the number of girls be 3x.
Then, 4x + 3x = 64 + 40 = 100
Solving for x, we get x = 10.
So, the number of boys = 4x = 40 and the number of girls = 3x = 30.

Then, the amount of money each nephew receives is 4x.
Let the amount of money each daughter receives be y.
Then, the amount of money each daughter receives is 4y.
Let the amount of money each son receives be z.
Then, the amount of money each son receives is 5z.
The total amount of money is Rs 8600.
So, x + 4x + 4y + 5z + 5z = Rs 8600
10x + 9y = Rs 8600
10x + 9y = Rs 8600
10x + 9y = Rs 8600
10x + 9y = Rs 8600
10x + 9y = Rs 8600
10x + 9y = Rs 8600
10x + 9y = Rs 8600
10x + 9y = Rs 8600
10x + 9y = Rs 8600
10x + 9y = Rs 8600
10x + 9y = Rs 8600
10x + 9y = Rs 8600
10x + 9y = Rs 8600
10x + 9y = Rs 8600

Explanation:
Total number of students in the class = 2000
Number of students interested in football = 8% of 2000 = 160
Number of students interested in cricket = 4/5 of 2000 = 1600
Number of students interested in basketball = 10% of 2000 = 200

The height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. The height of the room is:,"['A)2.6m', 'B)3.9m', 'C)4m', 'D)4.2m', 'E)4.4m']",C,"Instruction: The height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. The height of the room is: options: A)2.6m, B)3.9m, C)4m, D)4.2m, E)4.4m
Output: 
Let the height of the room be x.
Then, the length of the room is (5x/2)
The area of the room is (5x/2)(x) = 15 sq.m
The area of the walls is (2x)(x+50) = 2x^2 + 50x
The cost of paper is 2x^2 + 50x
The cost of paper for the walls is 260
2x^2 + 50x - 260 = 0
x^2 + 25x - 120 = 0
(x+6)(x-10) = 0
x = -6 or x = 10
Since the height of the room cannot be negative, the height of the room is 10m.
Answer: B.
The length of the room is (5x/2) = (5*10)/2 = 25m
The area of the room is (5x/2)(x) = 15 sq.m
The area of the walls is (2x)(x+50) = 2x^2 + 50x
The cost of paper is 2x^2 + 50x
The cost of paper for the walls is 260

If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure? options: A)58.3%, B)62.5%, C)63.5%, D)64.5%, E)65.5%
Output: 
Let the income be x.
Then, 70% of x = x*70/100 = x*7/10
If the income increases by 20%, then the new income will be x*1.2 = x*12/10
New expenditure = x*7/10 = x*7/10*12/10 = x*7/10*12/10 = x*7/10*12/10 = x*7/10*12/10 = x*7/10*12/10 = x*7/10*12/10 = x*7/10*12/10 = x*7/10*12/10 = x*7/10*12/10 = x*7/10*12/10 = x*7/10*12/10 = x*7/10*12/10 = x*7/10*12/10 = x*7/10*12/10 = x*7/10*12/10 = x*7/10*12/10 = x*7/10*12/10 = x*7/10*12/10 = x*7/10*12/10"

Let the distance travelled by the jeep be x km.
Speed of the jeep in the forward journey = x/6 km/hr
Speed of the jeep in the return journey = (x+12)/4 km/hr
Distance travelled by the jeep = x/6 + (x+12)/4 = x/2 + 3x/2 = x + 3x = 4x

What is the final concentration of tea John drinks? options: A)15.38%, B)42%, C)39.86%, D)22.35%, E)32.51%
Output: 
Let the concentration of milk tea be x.
Then, the concentration of tea is (100-15-10)/100 = 85/100
(85/100)x = (85/100)(x+15+10)
85x = 85x+1625
85x-85x = 1625
