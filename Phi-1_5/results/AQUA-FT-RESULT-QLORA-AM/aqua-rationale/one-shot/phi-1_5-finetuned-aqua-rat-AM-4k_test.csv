Instruction: You can purchase one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents, or two sodas and three energy bars for 300
cents. If the costs of the items do not change, compute the cost in cents of six sodas and seven bars. options: A)500, B)600, C)750, D)800, E)900
Output: 
Let the cost of each soda be x cents and the cost of each energy bar be y cents.
Then, 6x + 7y = 150
6x + 7y = 300
6x + 7y = 600
6x + 7y = 750
6x + 7y = 900

Output: 
Let the number of files infected by a virus be x.
Then, the number of files infected by a worm is 2.5x.
Since 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, the number of files infected by a virus is 50% of the total number of files, which is 0.5x.
The total number of files infected by a virus and a worm is 0.5x + 2.5x = 3.5x.
The number of files infected by a virus and a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm, which is 2.5(3.5x) = 8.75x.
The number of files infected by a virus and a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm, which is 2.5(50% of the total number of files) = 2.5(0.5x) = 1.25x.

Output: 
Let the number of flowers the bee will fly by be x.
x/100 = 8/100
x = 8
The bee will fly by 8 flowers.
The weight of the flowers is 0.05% of the total weight of the 10 vehicles.
The total weight of the 10 vehicles is 12.2 x 10 = 122
The total weight of the 8 flowers is 0.05 x 8 = 0.4
The total weight of the 10 vehicles and 8 flowers is 122 + 0.4 = 124.4
The total weight of the 10 vehicles and the new heavy duty truck is 124.4 + 2.6 = 127.4
127.4/10 = 12.7
The new heavy duty truck weighs 12.7 x 100 = 12700 tons.

Answer: E
The ratio of boys to girls is 4:3.
The number of boys is 4x and the number of girls is 3x.
The total number of members is 4x + 3x = 7x.
The ratio of boys to total members is 4:7x.
The number of boys is 4x/7x = 4/7.
The number of girls is 3x/7x = 3/7.
The total number of members is 4/7 + 3/7 = 7/7 = 1.

Output: 
The worker will take 9 minutes to drive from home to work at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour.
The worker will take 9 minutes to cycle from home to work at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour.
The total time it will take the worker to cycle from home to work along the same route is 9 + 9 = 18 minutes.
The total time it will take the worker to drive from home to work along the same route is 9 * 20 = 180 minutes.
The total time it will take the worker to cycle from home to work along the same route is 18 + 180 = 198 minutes.
The total time it will take the worker to cycle from home to work along the same route is 198 - 180 = 18 minutes.
The total time it will take the worker to cycle from home to work along the same route is 18 * 6 = 108 minutes.
The total time it will take the worker to cycle from home to work along the same route is 108 - 180 = -72 minutes.

Let x be the selling price per component.
The total revenue from selling 420 units at x is 420x.
The total production cost is 110x.
The minimum selling price that will guarantee a profit of at least $626,400 is:
626,400 = 420x + 110x - 110x

Output: 
Let the amount received by each nephew be x.
Then, amount received by each daughter = 4x
Amount received by each son = 5x
Total amount received by each nephew = 4x + 4x + 4x + 4x + 4x + 4x + 4x + 4x + 4x = 20x
Total amount received by each daughter = 20x + 4x + 4x + 4x + 4x + 4x + 4x + 4x + 4x = 80x
Total amount received by each son = 5x + 5x + 5x + 5x + 5x + 5x + 5x + 5x + 5x = 25x

Output: 
Let the speed of the ship be x miles per hour.
Then, the speed of the plane is 10x miles per hour.
The time taken to meet is 180/x + 180/10x = 180/5x
The distance traveled is 180 miles.
180/5x = 180
x = 360
The speed of the plane is 10x = 10 * 360 = 3600 miles per hour.
The distance traveled by the plane is 3600 * 180 = 5400 miles.
The distance traveled by the ship is 180 miles.
The distance traveled by the plane is 5400 - 180 = 5300 miles.
The distance traveled by the ship is 180 miles.
The distance traveled by the plane is 5300 - 180 = 5200 miles.
The distance traveled by the plane is 5200 - 180 = 5400 miles.
The distance traveled by the ship is 5400 - 180 = 5300 miles.
The distance traveled by the plane is 5300 - 180 = 5200 miles.

Output: 
Let x be the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and y be the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A.
The minimum daily requirement of vitamin E is 9x and the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A is 8y.
The minimum daily requirement of both vitamins is 9x + 8y.
The minimum daily requirement of the health food is 9x + 8y.
The minimum daily requirement of the health food is equal to the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins plus the minimum daily requirement of the health food.
9x + 8y + 9x + 8y = x + y + 9x + 8y
= 19x + 19y
= 19x + 19y
= 19x + 19y
= 19x + 19y
= 19x + 19y
= 19x + 19y
= 19x + 19y
= 19x + 19y
= 19x + 19y
= 19x + 19y
= 19x + 19y
= 19x + 19y
= 19x + 19y

Then, the time taken by Winson to run from home to school is x/10 hours.
The time taken by Winson to walk from home to school is x/5 hours.
The total time taken by Winson to run and walk from home to school is x/10 + x/5 = (5x + 10x)/10 = 15x/10 = 3x/2 hours.

Output: 
Let x be the number of senators Hoopsmot can influence.
Then, the total amount of money that Hoopsmot and Smolapon have is $16,000 + $4,000 = $20,000.
The ratio of money that Hoopsmot has to money that Smolapon has is 16,000/4,000 = 4/1.
The ratio of money that Hoopsmot can influence to money that Smolapon can influence is 4/1.
Therefore, 4/1 = x/30

Output: 
Let the age of the youngest member be x.
Then, the age of the second youngest member is x+3.
The age of the third youngest member is x+6.
The sum of the ages of all the members is 250.
x + (x+3) + (x+6) = 250
3x + 9 = 250
3x = 251
x = 83
The youngest member is 83 years old.
The age of the second youngest member is 83+3 = 88 years old.
The age of the third youngest member is 83+6 = 91 years old.
The sum of the ages of all the members is 83+88+91 = 250.

Output: 
Let the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z be 6x:9x and 7x:11x, respectively.
Then,
(6x + 9x + 7x + 11x) = 40 + 60 = 100
6x + 9x + 7x + 11x = 100
25x = 100
x = 4

Output: 
Let the number of pita breads be x.
Then, the number of rolls = 3
Number of baguettes = 5
Number of falafel in pita breads = x
Number of falafel in rolls = 3
Number of falafel in baguettes = 5
6x = 3(3)
6x = 9
x = 9/6
x = 1.5
Number of falafel in two baguettes = 5
Number of falafel in three baguettes = 5
Number of falafel in five baguettes = 5
5(5) = 25
25/3 = 8.33
Number of falafel in two pita breads = 1.5
Number of falafel in three pita breads = 1.5

Output: 
Let the height of the room be x.
Then, (2x + 5x)/2 = 260
7x = 260
x = 40
The height of the room is 4m.
The area of the room is (2 x 40 x 40) = 1600 sq.m.
The area of the doors and windows is (15 x 15) = 225 sq.m.
The area of the room that is to be covered with paper is 1600 - 225 = 1375 sq.m.
The area of paper required to cover the room is 1375/2 = 675 sq.m.
The area of paper required to cover the doors and windows is (75/2) x (75/2) = 675 sq.m.
The area of paper required to cover the room is 675 - 675 = 0 sq.m.
The area of paper required to cover the doors and windows is (75 x 75) = 5625 sq.m.
The area of paper required to cover the room is 5625 - 675 = 5125 sq.m.
