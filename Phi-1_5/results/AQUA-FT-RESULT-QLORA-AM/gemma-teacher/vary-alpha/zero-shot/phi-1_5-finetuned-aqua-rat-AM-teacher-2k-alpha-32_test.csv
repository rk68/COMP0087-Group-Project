How many letters need to be distinct? options: A)74453, B)64543, C)74325, D)65000, E)97656
Output: 

**Explanation:**

To form a distinct bike no. using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s, we need to choose 2 letters from the set of 26 letters and 2 no.'s from the set of 26 no.'s.

The number of distinct bike no.s that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s is given by the formula:

n(n+1) / 2 = C(26,2)

where n is the number of letters and C(26,2) is the number of distinct bike no.s that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s.

Substituting the values of n and C(26,2) into the formula, we get:

n(n+1) / 2 = C(26,2)

n(n+1) / 2 = C(26,2)

n(n+1) / 2 = C(26,2)

n(n+1) / 2 = C(26,2)

n(n+1) / 2 = C(26,2)

Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper? options: A)8.75, B)8.79, C)8.75, D)8.71, E)8.72
Output: 

**Explanation:**

The area of a square is given by the formula A = s^2, where s is the length of one side of the square.

The area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr^2, where r is the radius of the circle.

The area of a semi circle is given by the formula A = πr^2/2, where r is the radius of the semi circle.

If two semi circles are drawn on the opposite sides of a square, then the area of the remaining paper will be the area of the square minus the area of the two semi circles.

The area of the square is A = 20^2 = 400 square cm.

The area of the two semi circles is A = πr^2 = π(20)^2 = 400π square cm.

The area of the remaining paper is 400 - 400π = 400 - 400π square cm.

The answer is: B) 8.79

**The answer is:**

The area of the remaining paper is 8.79 square cm.

Round to the nearest hundredth. options: A)2 miles, B)2.25 miles, C)3.25 miles, D)3.85 miles, E)2.85 miles
Output: 

**Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled on a normal day.**

Bill's average speed on a normal day is 15 mph. Therefore, the distance traveled on a normal day is 15 miles per hour multiplied by the time traveled, which is 21 minutes.

**Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled on a windy day.**

On a windy day, Bill's speed is reduced by 4 mph. Therefore, the distance traveled on a windy day is 15 miles per hour multiplied by the time traveled, which is 21 minutes, minus 4 miles per hour multiplied by the time traveled, which is 21 minutes.

**Step 3: Calculate the distance traveled on a windy day.**

The distance traveled on a windy day is the difference between the distance traveled on a normal day and the distance traveled on a normal day minus the distance traveled on a normal day.

Output: 

**Explanation:**

The given equation is:

(5 +? × 19 - 15 - 7) / (13 × 13 - 156) = 6

We need to find the value of? that satisfies this equation.

**Step 1:**

Multiply both sides of the equation by 13:

5 +? × 19 - 15 - 7 = 13 × 13 - 156

**Step 2:**

Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:

? × 19 - 15 - 7 = 13 × 13 - 156 - 5

**Step 3:**

Divide both sides of the equation by 19:

? = (13 × 13 - 156 - 5) / 19

**Step 4:**

Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:

? = 13 × 13 - 156 - 5 / 19

**Step 5:**

Divide both sides of the equation by 13:

? = 13 - 156 / 19

Output: 

**Explanation:**

The speed of the ship is 180 miles per hour. The speed of the plane is 10 times the speed of the ship, which is 180 x 10 = 1800 miles per hour.

The time taken by the ship to travel 180 miles is 180/180 = 1 hour.

The time taken by the plane to travel the same distance is 180/1800 = 1/10 hour.

When they meet, the distance traveled by the ship and the plane is equal to the distance traveled by the ship. So, the distance traveled by the ship and the plane is 180 miles.

Therefore, the distance when they meet is 180 miles.

The rate of interest is? options: A)10%, B)12%, C)6%, D)8%, E)4%
Output: 

**Explanation:**

Simple interest is calculated as the product of the principal amount, the rate of interest, and the time period.

The formula for simple interest is:

S = P * R * T

where S is the simple interest, P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest, and T is the time period.

Given the information, we know that the simple interest is 72, the principal amount is Rs.5000, the rate of interest is B, and the time period is 2 years.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

72 = 5000 * 12 * 2

Solving for the rate of interest, we get:

R = 72 / (5000 * 12 * 2) = 0.012

**Explanation:**

Let's assume Joe's age is x, his sister's age is y and his father's age is z.

According to the first statement, x + y + z = 100.

When Joe is as old as his father, x = z.

Therefore, y = 2z.

Substituting y = 2z into the first statement, we get x + 2z + z = 100.

Simplifying the equation, we get 3z = 100 - x.

Solving for x, we get x = (100 - z) / 3.
