cents. If the costs of the items do not change, compute the cost in cents of six sodas and seven bars. options: A)500, B)600, C)750, D)800, E)900
Output: 

The cost of one soda is 150 cents, and the cost of one energy bar is 150 cents. Therefore, the cost of six sodas is 6 x 150 = 900 cents.

The cost of two sodas is 2 x 150 = 300 cents.

The cost of three energy bars is 3 x 150 = 450 cents.

The total cost of six sodas and seven energy bars is 900 + 300 + 450 = 1500 cents.

Therefore, the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars is 1500 cents.

Output: 

The formula to find the number of distinct bike no's is given by the formula:

n(n+1) = n(n-1) + 1

where n is the number of letters and n(n+1) is the number of distinct bike no's.

Substituting the values of n and n(n+1) into the formula, we get:

n(n+1) = n(n-1) + 1

n(n+1) = n(n-1) + 1

n(n+1) = n(n-1) + 1

n(n+1) = n(n-1) + 1

n(n+1) = n(n-1) + 1

n(n+1) = n(n-1) + 1

n(n+1) = n(n-1) + 1

n(n+1) = n(n-1) + 1

n(n+1) = n(n-1) + 1

Output: 

**Explanation:**

To reach a salary of at least $1000, the sales person must make a total of at least $1000 in sales. To find the number of sales required, we need to divide the salary by the commission rate.

The commission rate is 10%, which means that for each sale, the sales person will earn 10% of the sale price as commission.

To find the number of sales required, we need to divide the salary by the commission rate.

$1000 / 0.10 = 1000 sales

Therefore, the sales person must make a total of 1000 sales in order to reach a salary of at least $1000.

Output: 

The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?

The answer is: D) 36%

Explanation:

1. Calculate the original retail price of the appliance, which is 60% more than its wholesale cost.

Original retail price = Wholesale cost + 60% of wholesale cost

2. Calculate the discounted price of the appliance, which is 20% less than the original retail price.

Discounted price = Original retail price - 20% of original retail price

3. Calculate the net profit of the appliance, which is the discounted price minus the wholesale cost.

Net profit = Discounted price - Wholesale cost

4. Calculate the percentage of the net profit that is the additional cost.

Additional cost = Net profit / Wholesale cost * 100%

5. Calculate the percentage of the net profit that is the additional cost.

Additional cost percentage = Additional cost / Net profit * 100%

Output: 

The formula for the length of a line segment is given by the formula:

L = √(s^2 + t^2)

where L is the length of the line segment, s is the length of the segment, and t is the length of the segment.

Substituting the values of s, t, and L into the formula, we get:

s^2 + t^2 = 5^2 + 17^2 + 22^2

s^2 + t^2 = 25 + 289 + 522

s^2 + t^2 = 562

s = √562

s = 26

t = √562

t = 26

Output: 

The formula for speed is given by the formula:

Speed = Distance/Time

We know that the distance covered is the same, so we can rearrange the formula as:

Speed = Distance/Time

Substituting the values of distance and time, we get:

Speed = Distance/10

Speed = 60 km/hr

Therefore, the speed gained is:

Speed gained = 60 km/hr - 50 km/hr = 10 km/hr

The answer is: C

The total cost of the candy bars is more than $4, so the number of ways to select 3 candy bars that cost more than $4 is:

Number of ways = C(11, 3)

Number of ways = 11! / (3!(11-3)!)

Number of ways = 11! / (3!8!)

Number of ways = 11! / (3!8!)

Number of ways = 11! / (3!8!)

Output: 

The question is asking for the distance Bill can travel on a windy day in 21 minutes. Bill's speed is reduced by 4 mph on a windy day, so his speed is 15 - 4 = 11 mph.

To find the distance traveled, we need to multiply the speed by the time. The time is 21 minutes, which is equivalent to 21/60 = 0.35 hours.

The distance traveled is 11 x 0.35 = 3.85 miles.

Instruction: 64 boys and 40 girls form a group for social work. During their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. How many members does the group have now, if the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3? options: A)277, B)288, C)200, D)277, E)168
Output: 

The ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, which means that for every 4 boys, there are 3 girls. So, if there are a total of 64 boys and 40 girls, then the number of boys in the group is 4/7 of the total number of members. Therefore, the number of boys in the group is 4/7 * 64 = 28.

The number of girls in the group is 3/7 of the total number of members. Therefore, the number of girls in the group is 3/7 * 40 = 20.

The total number of members in the group is 28 + 20 = 48.

The probability of the man catching the first train is the number of ways to choose the first train from the total number of trains that come in a day, which is 10. The number of ways to choose the first train from the total number of trains that come in a day is 10. Therefore, the probability of the man catching the first train is 10/10 = 1.

Instruction: Suppose you can travel from a place M to a place N by 3 buses, from place N to place O by 4 buses, from place O to place P by 1 buses and from place P to place Q by 3 buses. In how many ways can you travel from M to Q ? options: A)24, B)36, C)72, D)84, E)None
Output: 

The total number of ways to travel from M to Q is given by the formula:

nCk = n! / (k!(n-k)!)

where n is the number of ways to travel from M to Q and k is the number of steps you take to reach Q.

For the first part of the journey, you take 20 steps and stop, so the number of ways to travel from M to Q is 20C20 = 1.

For the second part of the journey, you take 10 steps and stop, so the number of ways to travel from N to Q is 10C10 = 1.

Therefore, the total number of ways to travel from M to Q is 1 + 1 = 2.

The speed of the elevator is given by the formula:

Speed = Distance/Time

where Distance is the total distance traveled and Time is the total time taken.

The total distance traveled is 20 + 10 = 30 steps.

The total time taken is 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

Therefore, the speed of the elevator is 30/30 = 1 step/minute.

Output: Answer: D

Instruction: If a man rows at the rate of 4 kmph in still water and his rate against the current is 2 kmph, then the man's rate along the current is: options: A)15 kmph, B)6 kmph, C)12 kmph, D)14 kmph, E)6 kmph
Output: 

The capacity of a tank of dimensions (8 m × 6 m × 2.5 m) is 120 litres.

The man's rate against the current is 2 kmph.

Therefore, the man's rate along the current is:

2 kmph - 4 kmph = -2 kmph

The negative sign indicates that the man's rate along the current is in the opposite direction of the flow.

The formula for the rate of a man against the current is:

Rate = Velocity - Velocity of the current

Substituting the values of velocity and velocity of the current into the formula, we get:

Rate = 2 kmph - 2 kmph = 0 kmph

The rate of a man against the current is 0 kmph.

The capacity of a tank of dimensions (8 m × 6 m × 2.5 m) is 120 litres.

The man's rate against the current is 0 kmph.

Therefore, the man's rate along the current is:

Output: 

**Explanation:**

Given information:
n = 36, x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4)

We know that the number of students who took physics is 20% of the total number of students, which is 20% of 36 = 0.2 * 36 = 7.2 students.

Similarly, the number of students who took math is 28% of the total number of students, which is 28% of 36 = 0.28 * 36 = 8.4 students.

Therefore, the total number of students who took physics and math is 7.2 + 8.4 = 15.6 students.

The least possible number of students in the school is the number of students who took physics and math, which is 15.6 students.

**The answer is:** D) 28

The answer is 28 because the number of students who took physics and math is the same as the number of students who took physics and math, which is 15.6 students.

Output: 

The speed of the ship is 180 miles per hour. So, the speed of the plane is 10 times the speed of the ship, which is 180 x 10 = 1800 miles per hour.

The time taken by the ship to travel 180 miles is 180/180 = 1 hour.

The time taken by the plane to travel the same distance is 200/1800 = 0.1111 hours.

Therefore, the distance traveled by the plane is 0.1111 x 180 = 23.88 miles.

The distance traveled by the ship is 180 miles.

The total distance traveled by the ship and the plane is 180 + 23.88 = 213.88 miles.

The distance traveled by the plane is 10 times the distance traveled by the ship, which is 10 x 180 = 1800 miles.

Therefore, the distance traveled by the plane is 1800 miles.

The distance traveled by the plane is equal to the distance traveled by the ship, which is 1800 miles.

The distance traveled by the plane is equal to the distance traveled by the ship, which is 23.88 miles.

The distance traveled by the plane is equal to the distance traveled by the ship, which is","Instruction: A father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan who are 23 and 24 at present.

Output: 

**Explanation:**

The minimum daily requirement of vitamin E is 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. Therefore, to obtain at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, the health food must contain at least 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A and 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E.

If the health food contains 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A and 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E, then the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A is 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A and the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E is 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E.

Therefore, the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A is 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A and the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E is 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E.

To obtain at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, the health food must contain at least 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A and 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E.

To find the new length, we need to find the common ratio between the original length and the reduced length.

The common ratio is 3/5.

To find the new length, we need to multiply the original length by the common ratio.

The new length is 30 * 3/5 = 18 cm.

How many students are there in the class? options: A)850, B)800, C)900, D)950, E)1000
Output: 

**Explanation:**

1. Calculate the number of students interested in Football: 8% of total students = 0.08 * Total students
2. Calculate the number of students interested in Cricket: 4/5 of total students = 0.4 * Total students
3. Calculate the number of students interested in Basketball: 10% of total students = 0.1 * Total students
4. Calculate the number of students not interested in any games: 20 students = Total students - (0.08 * Total students + 0.4 * Total students + 0.1 * Total students)
5. Substitute the value of Total students from the previous step into the equation: 20 students = Total students - (0.08 * Total students + 0.4 * Total students + 0.1 * Total students)
6. Solve for Total students: Total students = 20 students + 0.08 * Total students + 0.4 * Total students + 0.1 * Total students
7. Simplify the equation: Total students = 20 students + 0.48 * Total students
8. Divide both sides of the equation by 0.48: Total students = 25 * Total students","Instruction: It takes a worker 9 minutes to drive from home to work at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour.

The volume of a cube is given by the formula V = s^3, where V is the volume and s is the length of the side of the cube. The volume of a sphere is given by the formula V = (4/3)πr^3, where V is the volume and r is the radius of the sphere.

If the volume of the cube is V and the volume of the sphere is V, then the ratio of the volumes of the cube to that of the sphere is V/V = s^3/r^3.

We know that V = 70 and V = 90, so we can substitute these values into the equation to get 70/90 = s^3/r^3.

Solving for s, we get s = 10.

1. 10! / 3! = 10 ways
2. 10! / 6! = 10 ways
3. 10! / 2! = 10 ways
4. 10! / 4! = 10 ways
5. 10! / 5! = 10 ways

The answer is: B

The distance travelled by the jeep is 126km.

The explanation:

The speed of the jeep during the forward journey is 6km/hr. Therefore, the time taken to cover the distance is 6 hours.

The speed of the jeep during the return journey is 12km/hr. Therefore, the time taken to cover the distance is 4 hours.

The total time taken to cover the distance is 6 + 4 = 10 hours.

The formula for the time taken to cover a distance is:

Time taken = Distance / Speed

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:

10 = Distance / 6

Distance = 6 * 10 = 60km

The answer is: B

The difference between the squares of two numbers is 256000. So, the square of the number that is greater than the square of the other number is 256000 - 400 = 2600.

The sum of the numbers is 1000. So, the number that is greater than the other number is 1000 - 400 = 600.

The number that is greater than the other number is 600 + 400 = 1000.

The number that is greater than the other number is 600 + 400 = 1000.

The number that is greater than the other number is 600 + 400 = 1000.

Output: 

**Explanation:**

1. Arrange the children on the chairs in a straight line.
2. Susan is on the left of Tim.
3. There are 3 ways to arrange the children on the chairs.

**The answer is:** D

The total number of ways to arrange the children on the chairs is 3! = 6.

The number of ways to arrange the children on the chairs so that Susan is on the left of Tim is 3! - 1 = 6.

Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange the children on the chairs is 6.

The price at which the retailer sold the appliance is $63.00.

**The answer is:** D

The total cost of the appliance is $20.00.

The total profit is $20.00.

The total cost of the appliance is $20.00 + $20.00 = $40.00.

The total profit is $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

The total cost of the appliance is $20.00 + $20.00 = $40.00.

Output: 

The monthly salary S of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales.

To find the new monthly sales, we need to first calculate the new salary S after the increase in income.

New salary S = $500 + 0.05(S)

where S is the monthly sales.

To find the new monthly sales, we need to find the value of S that maximizes the new salary S.

S = $500 + 0.05(S)

S = $500 + 0.05(S)

S = $500 + 0.05(S)

S = $500 + 0.05(S)

S = $500 + 0.05(S)

S = $500 + 0.05(S)

S = $500 + 0.05(S)

S = $500 + 0.05(S)

S = $500 + 0.05(S)

S = $500 + 0.05(S)

S = $500 + 0.05(S)

S = $500","Instruction: The monthly salary S of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. What should the monthly sales be so that her monthly salary reaches $1500? options: A)$50000, B)$40000, C)$30000, D)$20000, E)None of these

Output: 

The length of the rectangular piece is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth. So, the length is 4 times the breadth plus 1m.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:

Perimeter = 2(length + breadth)

Substituting the values of length and breadth into the formula, we get:

Perimeter = 2(4(4m) + 1m)

Perimeter = 2(16m + 1m)

Perimeter = 2(17m)

Perimeter = 34m

The minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 is $230.

If train is traveling at 120 mile an hour, how long will it take to pass completely through the tunnel ? options: A)43 seconds, B)39 seconds, C)20 seconds, D)33 seconds, E)55 seconds
Output: 

The train is traveling at 120 miles per hour, which means it covers 120 miles in one second. Therefore, it will take 3 seconds to enter the tunnel.

The total time taken to pass through the tunnel will be 3 seconds + 3 seconds = 6 seconds.

The total time taken to pass through the tunnel will be 6 seconds + 3 seconds = 9 seconds.

The total time taken to pass through the tunnel will be 9 seconds + 3 seconds = 12 seconds.

The total time taken to pass through the tunnel will be 12 seconds + 3 seconds = 15 seconds.

The total time taken to pass through the tunnel will be 15 seconds + 3 seconds = 18 seconds.

The total time taken to pass through the tunnel will be 18 seconds + 3 seconds = 21 seconds.

The total time taken to pass through the tunnel will be 21 seconds + 3 seconds = 24 seconds.

The total time taken to pass through the tunnel will be 24 seconds + 3 seconds = 27 seconds.

The total time taken to pass through the tunnel will be 27 seconds + 3 seconds = 30 seconds.
