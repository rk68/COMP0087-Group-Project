ANSWER:E Answer: E

Instruction: You can purchase one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents, or two sodas and three energy bars for 300
cents. If the costs of the items do not change, compute the cost in cents of six sodas and seven bars. options: A)500, B)600, C)750, D)800, E)900
Output: 

If the cost of one soda is x cents, then the cost of two sodas is 2x cents.

If the cost of one energy bar is y cents, then the cost of three energy bars is 3y cents.

The total cost of six sodas and seven energy bars is 6x + 7y cents.

We know that the total cost is 150 cents, so we can write the equation:

6x + 7y = 150

To find the value of x and y, we need to solve for x and y.

One way to solve this equation is to use the fact that the cost of two sodas is twice the cost of one energy bar. So, we can write:

2x = 2y

x = y

Substituting this into the equation, we get:

6x + 7y = 150

6x + 7y = 150

6x + 7y = 150

x = y

The answer is: E

The cost of six sodas and seven energy bars is 600 cents.

**Note:** The answer is E, not B.

**Explanation:**

The cost of one soda is x cents, and the cost of two sodas is 2x cents. So, the total cost of six sodas is 6x cents.

The cost of one energy","Instruction: A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews.

Instruction: Boomtown urban planners expect the city’s population to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year? options: A)20%, B)40%, C)50%, D)65%, E)75%
Output: 

The population of Boomtown is expected to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago.

To find the percent population increase, we need to calculate the percentage increase in population over one year.

Percentage increase = (New population - Old population) / Old population * 100%

Percentage increase = (2 * Old population) / Old population * 100%

To find the percent population increase, we need to find the value of Old population.

Old population = (2 * Population increase) / 10%

Old population = (2 * Population increase) / 10% * 100%

Old population = Population increase

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is: B

The population of Boomtown is expected to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago.

The percent population increase is the percentage increase in population over one year.

Percent population increase = (2 * Population increase) / Old population * 100%

Percent population increase = (2 * Population increase) / Old population * 100%

Old population = (2 * Population increase) / 10%

Old population = Population increase

Output: If ball A makes 2 rotations in 26 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 13 minutes. If ball B makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 7 minutes.
The two balls start rotating now and makes several rotations before they are at the SAME starting points. Ball A would have done a WHOLE number X of rotations and ball B would have done a WHOLE number Y of rotations. Also they would have rotated during the same period of time T. Hence
T = 13 X = 7 Y
Hence 13 X = 7 Y
Solve the above for X
X = 7 Y / 13
We want the time when they are FIRST at the same starting point. Therefore X and Y are the smallest whole numbers of the equation X = 7 Y / 13. The smallest value of Y that gives X as a whole number is 13. Hence
X = 7 (13) / 13 = 7
Time T is given by
T = 13 X = 13 * 7 = 91 minutes = 1 hour and 31 minutes

Instruction: A car finishes a journey in 20 hours at the speed of 60 km/hr. If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, how much speed does the car gain? options: A)80 kmph, B)50 kmph, C)120 kmph, D)70 kmph, E)80 kmph
Output: 
The speed of the car is directly proportional to the time taken to cover the distance. So, if the time taken is reduced by half, the speed of the car will also be reduced by half.

If the speed is reduced by half, the time taken will be 20/2 = 10 hours.

If the speed is reduced by half, the distance covered will be the same.

So, the speed gained is 20 - 10 = 10 kmph.

Answer B Answer: B

Instruction: A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point. options: A)238, B)289, C)200, D)287, E)187
Output: 

The speed of the ship is 180 miles per hour. So, the speed of the plane is 10 times the speed of the ship, which is 180 x 10 = 1800 miles per hour.

The time taken by the ship to travel 180 miles is 180/180 = 1 hour.

The time taken by the plane to travel the same distance is 200/1800 = 0.1111 hours.

The distance traveled by the plane is 0.1111 x 180 = 19.11 miles.

Therefore, the distance when they meet from starting point is 19.11 miles.

The answer is: B

**Note:** The answer is B because the speed of the plane is 10 times the speed of the ship, and the time taken by the plane to travel the same distance is 0.1111 hours.

**End of the Question:**

The answer is: B

**Additional Information:**

The formula for calculating the distance traveled by a plane is given by the formula:

Distance = Speed x Time

where Distance is the distance traveled, Speed is the speed of the plane, and Time is the time taken by the plane to travel the distance.

In this question, the speed of the plane is 10 times the speed of the ship, which is 180 miles per hour. So, the speed of the plane is 10 x 180 = 1800 miles per hour.

Output: 

The simple interest is given by the formula I = P*r*t, where I is the simple interest, P is the principal, r is the rate of interest, and t is the time period.

Substituting the values into the formula, we get I = 5000*0.12*2 = Rs. 1200.

The C.I. is given by the formula C.I. = P*r*t, where C.I. is the C.I. at the same rate for Rs.5000 for 2 years in Rs.72.

Substituting the values into the formula, we get C.I. = 5000*0.12*2 = Rs. 1200.

Instruction: The monthly salary S of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. What should the monthly sales be so that her monthly salary reaches $1500? options: A)$50000, B)$40000, C)$30000, D)$20000, E)None of these
Output: 

The formula for the monthly salary is S = 500 + 0.05S

We need to find the value of S that makes S = 1500.

Substituting S = 1500 into the formula, we get:

1500 = 500 + 0.05S

Solving for S, we get:

S = $3000

Therefore, the monthly sales should be $3000.

Answer: B) $4000

The monthly sales should be $4000 to reach a monthly salary of $1500.

**Note:** The answer is B) $4000.

**End of the section:**

In this section, we learned about the concept of distance and how it is related to speed. We also learned about the formula for calculating distance and how it can be used to find the distance traveled by a ship and a plane. Finally, we learned about the formula for calculating monthly salary and how it can be used to find the monthly sales required to reach a certain salary.

**Examples:**

1. A ship traveled 120 miles in 2 hours. What was its speed?

Answer: The speed of the ship was 60 miles/hr.

2. A plane traveled 300 miles in 4 hours. What was its speed?

Answer: The speed of the plane was 75 miles/hr.

Output: 

The length of the ribbon was originally 30 cm. It was reduced in the ratio 5 : 3.

To find the length of the ribbon after the reduction, we need to find the new length of the ribbon after the reduction.

The new length of the ribbon after the reduction is 5/3 times the original length of the ribbon.

New length of the ribbon = 5/3 * 30 = 20 cm

The formula for calculating the time taken by a train to cover a certain distance is given by the formula:

Time = Distance/Speed

We know that the distance covered by train ‘A’ is 3/5 of the total distance covered by train ‘B’. So, the time taken by train ‘A’ to cover the distance covered by train ‘B’ is 3/5 of the time taken by train ‘B’ to cover the distance covered by train ‘B’.

Therefore, the time taken by train ‘A’ to cover the distance covered by train ‘B’ is 3/5 of the time taken by train ‘B’ to cover the distance covered by train ‘B’.

To find the time taken by train ‘A’ to cover the distance covered by train ‘B’, we need to find the time taken by train ‘B’ to cover the distance covered by train ‘B’.

The time taken by train ‘B’ to cover the distance covered by train ‘B’ is given by the formula:

Instruction: The ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which will fit inside the cube is? options: A)2: π, B)7:2, C)8:2, D)6: π, E)8:3
Output: 
The volume of a cube is given by the formula V = s^3, where s is the length of one side of the cube. The volume of a sphere is given by the formula V = (4/3)πr^3, where r is the radius of the sphere.

The ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which will fit inside the cube is V/V_sphere = s^3/r^3.

Substituting the values of V and V_sphere into the equation, we get:

s^3/r^3 = V/V_sphere

s^3/r^3 = V/V_sphere

s^3/r^3 = V/V_sphere

s^3/r^3 = V/V_sphere

s^3/r^3 = V/V_sphere

s^3/r^3 = V/V_sphere

s^3/r^3 = V/V_sphere

Output: 

The points A,B,C,D,E and F form a regular pentagon. To form a quadrilateral, we need to choose 4 points from the pentagon.

The number of ways to choose 4 points from a pentagon is given by the formula:

nC4 = n! / (4!(n-4)!)

where n is the number of points in the pentagon.

Substituting the values of n into the formula, we get:

nC4 = 5! / (4!(5-4)!) = 5! / (4!1!) = 5

Answer C Answer: C

Instruction: Joe's age, Joe's sister's age and Joe’s fathers age sums up to 100. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Find the age of Joe's father? options: A)45, B)48, C)50, D)55, E)58
Output: 
Let's assume Joe's age is x, his sister's age is y and his father's age is z.

According to the question, we have
x + y + z = 100

When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now.

When Joe is as old as his father, his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father.

So, we can write the following equations:

x = z
y = 2z

Substituting the value of x in the first equation, we get:

z + y + z = 100

Substituting the value of y in the second equation, we get:

z = 2z

Substituting the value of z in the first equation, we get:

z + 2z = 100

3z = 100

z = 33.33

Therefore, Joe's father's age is 33.33.

Answer: B)48

**Note:** The answer is 48.

**Explanation:**

1. Solve the equation x + y + z = 100 for z.
2. Substitute the value of z in the equation x = z.
3. Substitute the value of z in the equation y = 2z.
4. Solve for y","Instruction: What will be the cost of gardening 1-metre – broad boundary around a rectangular plot having perimeter of 340 metres at the rate of 10 per square metre? options: A)3400, B)1700, C)3440, D)Cannot be determined, E)None of these

Output: 

The man spends 70% of his income, which means that he spends 0.7 * income on his expenses. If his income increases by 20%, then his new income will be 1.2 * income. Therefore, his new expenditure will be 0.7 * 1.2 * income = 0.84 * income.

The new expenditure will be 0.84 * income = 0.84 * income * 0.7 = 0.588 * income.

Instruction: A rectangular piece of 150 sq m has a length which is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth. What is the perimeter of the piece? options: A)60 m, B)61 m, C)62 m, D)63 m, E)64 m
Output: 

The length of the rectangular piece is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth. So, the length is 4 times the breadth plus 1m.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + b).

Substituting the values of length and breadth into the formula, we get P = 2(4(b) + b) = 2(4b + b) = 8b + 2b = 10b

Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangular piece is 10b.
