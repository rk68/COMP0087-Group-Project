Instruction: Two ants are moving from their farms towards each other. Ant A is moving at a speed of 9 cm per hour and ant B is moving at a speed of 6 cm per hour. If the farms are 75 cm away from each other, what will be the distance (in cm) that ant A travels until meeting ant B? options: A)45, B)48, C)51, D)54, E)57
Output: 

The distance that ant A travels before meeting ant B is given by the formula:

Distance = Speed x Time

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:

Distance = 9 x Time

Since the distance between the farms is 75 cm, we can write:

9 x Time = 75

Solving for Time, we get:

Time = 75/9 = 8.33 hours

Therefore, the distance that ant A travels before meeting ant B is:

Distance = 9 x 8.33 = 83.9 cm

The average speed of the plane around the field is given by the formula:

Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:

Instruction: A car finishes a journey in 20 hours at the speed of 60 km/hr. If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, how much speed does the car gain? options: A)80 kmph, B)50 kmph, C)120 kmph, D)70 kmph, E)80 kmph
Output: 

The car's speed is directly proportional to the time taken to cover the distance. Therefore, if the time taken is reduced by half, the speed of the car will also be reduced by half.

The new speed of the car will be 60 kmph/hr * 0.5 = 30 kmph/hr.

The total cost of the candy bars will be 30 * 3 = $90.

The total cost of the candy bars will be $4 more than the cost of the candy bars that cost $1 each.

The area of the square is given by the formula A = s^2, where A is the area, s is the length of each side.

Since the area of the rectangle is equal to the area of the square, we can write the equation as:

Output: 

Bill's average speed on a normal day is 15 mph. On a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph, so his average speed is 15 - 4 = 11 mph.

To find the distance traveled in 21 minutes, we need to convert 21 minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 21 minutes is equal to 21/60 = 0.35 hours.

The distance traveled is equal to the product of the average speed and the time traveled. So, the distance traveled is 11 mph * 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles.

Output: 

The cost of the appliance is $20.00, which is 20% of the selling price. Therefore, the selling price is $20.00 + $20.00 = $40.00.

The profit is $20.00, which is 20% of the selling price. Therefore, the cost of the appliance is $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

The selling price is $20.00, which is 20% of the cost. Therefore, the cost of the appliance is $20.00 / 20% = $100.00.

The cost of the appliance is $100.00, which is 20% of the selling price. Therefore, the selling price is $100.00 / 20% = $50.00.

The selling price is $50.00, which is 20% of the cost. Therefore, the cost of the appliance is $50.00 / 20% = $100.00.

The cost of the appliance is $100.00, which is 20% of the selling price. Therefore, the selling price is $100.00 / 20% = $50.00.

**Explanation:**

Given information:

n = 36, x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4)

n2 = 36^2 = 1296

n = 1296 / 2 = 648

x = 648 * (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4)

x = 648 * (1296 + 2√648(648 + 4) + 16) / (648 + 4√648 + 4)

x = 648 * (1296 + 2√648(648 + 4) + 16) / (648 + 4√648 + 4)

x = 648 * (1296 + 2√648(648 + 4) + 16) / (648 + 4√648 + 4)

x = 648 * (1296 + 2√648(648 + 4) + 16) / (648 + 4√648 + 4)

Output: 

The ship traveled 180 miles, so the speed of the ship is 180/10 = 18 miles per hour.

The plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship, so the speed of the plane is 10*18 = 180 miles per hour.

When they meet, the distance traveled by the ship and the plane will be equal to the distance traveled by the ship.

Therefore, the distance traveled by the ship and the plane will be 180 miles.

The distance traveled by the plane is equal to the distance traveled by the ship, so the distance traveled by the plane is 180 miles.

The speed of the plane is equal to the speed of the ship, so the speed of the plane is 18 miles per hour.

The time taken by the ship to travel 180 miles is 180/18 = 10 hours.

The time taken by the plane to travel 180 miles is 180/18 = 10 hours.

To find the length of the ribbon now, we need to first find the number of ways to allocate the meals.

The number of ways to allocate the meals is given by the formula:

nCk = n! / (k!(n-k)!)

where n is the total number of meals and k is the number of meals allocated.

For example, if there are 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week, the number of meals allocated is 3C3 = 1.

If Fernando goes home for a dinner on Friday nights, the number of meals allocated is 3C4 = 3.

Therefore, the number of ways to allocate meals is 1 + 3 = 4.

The length of the ribbon now is 30 * 4 = 120 cm.

Output: 

The minimum daily requirement of vitamin E is 9 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. Therefore, the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E is 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A.

To obtain the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and vitamin A, one must eat a certain amount of health food. The amount of health food required to provide the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and vitamin A is equal to the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and vitamin A multiplied by the number of grams of health food eaten daily.

The number of grams of health food eaten daily is equal to the number of grams of health food eaten daily multiplied by the number of days in a week.

The number of days in a week is 7.

Therefore, the number of grams of health food eaten daily is equal to the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and vitamin A multiplied by the number of days in a week.

The number of grams of health food eaten daily is equal to 8.5 * 7 = 59.5 grams.

Output: 

The number is 2/3 of the number. So, the number of ways to create 2 groups of 5 members each is 2/3 of the number.

2/3 of the number is equal to 40 + 1/3 of the number.

Therefore, the number of ways to create 2 groups of 5 members each is 2/3 of the number multiplied by 40 + 1/3 of the number.

2/3 of the number multiplied by 40 is equal to 160.

1/3 of the number is equal to 1/3 of the number.

Therefore, the number of ways to create 2 groups of 5 members each is 160 + 1/3 of the number.

The number of ways to create 2 groups of 5 members each is 160 + 1/3 of the number.

The number of ways to create 2 groups of 5 members each is 160 + 1/3 of the number.

Instruction: The length of the ribbon was originally 30 cm. It was reduced in the ratio 5 : 3. What is its length now? options: A)18, B)30, C)6, D)15, E)12
Output: 

The length of the ribbon was originally 30 cm. It was reduced in the ratio 5 : 3.

To find the length of the ribbon after reduction, we need to find the new length of the ribbon after the reduction.

The new length of the ribbon after reduction is given by the formula:

New Length = Original Length * (Reduction Ratio / Original Ratio)

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:

New Length = 30 * (3 / 5) = 18 cm

Therefore, the length of the ribbon after reduction is 18 cm.

The minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 is:

Minimum Selling Price = Production Cost + Profit

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:

Minimum Selling Price = $110 + $626,400 = $626,410

The time taken for one train to complete its journey is 16 minutes. Therefore, the time taken for two trains to complete their journey is 16 minutes.

The distance covered by one train in 16 minutes is 9 cm. Therefore, the distance covered by two trains in 16 minutes is 9 cm x 2 = 18 cm.

The distance covered by two trains in 17 minutes is 6 cm. Therefore, the distance covered by two trains in 17 minutes is 6 cm x 2 = 12 cm.

The total distance covered by two trains in 17 minutes is 18 cm + 12 cm = 30 cm.

The total distance covered by two trains is 75 cm. Therefore, the distance covered by ant A is 30 cm.

The distance covered by ant B is 75 cm - 30 cm = 45 cm.

The distance covered by ant A is 45 cm.

Output: 

The flagstaff 17.5 metre high casts a shadow of length 40.25 metre. The height of building, which casts a shadow of length 28.75 metre under similar conditions, will be 12.5 metre.

The answer is: B

The explanation:

To find the height of the building, we need to use the formula for the area of a triangle, which is A = 1/2 * base * height.

The base of the triangle is the length of the shadow of the building, which is 28.75 metre.

The height of the triangle is the difference between the squares of the numbers, which is 256000 - 400000 = 256000.

The area of the triangle is 1/2 * 28.75 * 256000 = 256000 square metres.

To find the age of Joe's father, we need to find the age of Joe's sister and then double it.

If Joe's sister is twice as old as her father, then Joe's sister's age is 2 * Joe's father's age.

If Joe's father is twice as old as his sister, then Joe's father's age is 2 * Joe's sister's age.

If Joe's father's age is twice as old as his sister's age, then Joe's father's age is 2 * 2 * Joe's sister's age.

If Joe's father's age is twice as old as his sister's age, then Joe's father's age is 2 * 2 * 2 * Joe's sister's age.

Output: 

**Step 1: Calculate the savings per issue.**

Savings per issue = 25% of cover price = 0.25 * cover price

**Step 2: Calculate the cost per issue.**

Cost per issue = cover price - savings per issue = cover price - 0.25 * cover price = 0.75 * cover price

**Step 3: Substitute the value of the savings per issue into the equation.**

0.75 * cover price = $42.00

**Step 4: Solve for the cover price.**

cover price = $42.00 / 0.75 = $56.00

Instruction: The height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. The height of the room is: options: A)2.6m, B)3.9m, C)4m, D)4.2m, E)4.4m
Output: 

The height of the room is 2:5, which means that the height of the room is 2/5 of the total height of the room. Therefore, the height of the room is 2/5 of the total height of the room, which is 2/5 * 2 = 0.4m.

The area of the room is 15 sq.m, which is equal to the area of the walls of the room. The area of the walls of the room is 2 * 0.4m * 2 = 0.8m^2.

The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m, which is equal to the area of the doors and windows.

Therefore, the total area of the walls of the room is 0.8m^2.

Output: 

The length of the rectangular piece is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth. So, the length is 4 times the breadth plus 1m.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:

Perimeter = 2(length + breadth)

Substituting the values of length and breadth into the formula, we get:

Perimeter = 2(4(4m) + 1m)

Perimeter = 2(16m + 1m)

Perimeter = 2(17m)

Instruction: John likes to have lightly flavored tea every evening. In a 50% strong milk tea, he replaces 15% of it with milk twice. Then, he replaces 10 percent of the resultant solution with more milk.
What is the final concentration of tea John drinks? options: A)15.38%, B)42%, C)39.86%, D)22.35%, E)32.51%
Output: 

John replaces 15% of the tea with milk twice, which is a total of 15% x 2 = 30% of the tea.

After replacing 30% of the tea with milk, John has 50% - 30% = 20% of the tea left.

John replaces 10% of the remaining tea with more milk, which is a total of 10% x 20% = 2% of the remaining tea.

Therefore, the final concentration of tea John drinks is 20% - 2% = 18%.
