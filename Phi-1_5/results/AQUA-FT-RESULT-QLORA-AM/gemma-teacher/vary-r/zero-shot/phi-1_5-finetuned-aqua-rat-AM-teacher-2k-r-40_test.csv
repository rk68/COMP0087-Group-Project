How many letters need to be distinct? options: A)74453, B)64543, C)74325, D)65000, E)97656
Output: 

**Explanation:**

To form a distinct bike no. using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s, we need to choose 2 letters from the set of 26 letters and 2 no.'s from the set of 26 no.'s.

The number of distinct bike no.s that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s is given by the formula:

$$n(n+1)(n+2) = n(n+1)(n+2)$$

where n is the number of letters and (n+1)(n+2) is the number of distinct bike no.s that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s.

Substituting the values of n and (n+1)(n+2) into the formula, we get:

$$n(n+1)(n+2) = n(n+1)(n+2) = n(n+1)(n+2) = n(n+1)(n+2) = n(n+1)(n+2) = n(n+1)(n+2) = n(n+1"

Output: 

**Explanation:**

The area of a square is given by the formula A = s^2, where s is the length of one side of the square.

The area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr^2, where r is the radius of the circle.

The area of a semi circle is given by the formula A = πr^2, where r is the radius of the semi circle.

If two semi circles are drawn on the opposite sides of a square, then the area of the remaining paper will be the area of the square minus the area of the two semi circles.

The area of the square is A = 20^2 = 400 square cm.

The area of the two semi circles is A = πr^2 = π(20)^2 = 400π square cm.

Therefore, the area of the remaining paper is 400 - 400π square cm.

After how many hours will they be able to buy the cake together? options: A)1 hour, B)2 hours, C)3 hours, D)4 hours, E)5 hours
Output: 

**Explanation:**

Sharon and Karen work together to earn enough tips to buy an ice cream cake. Sharon works for 5 hours and Karen works for 4 hours. Therefore, the total number of hours they work together is 5 + 4 = 9 hours.

To buy the cake, they need to earn enough tips to cover the cost of the cake. The cost of the cake is $10. Therefore, the number of tips they need to earn is $10.

The number of tips they need to earn is equal to the cost of the cake divided by the number of hours they work together. Therefore, the number of tips they need to earn is $10 / 9 = $1.11.

The number of hours they need to work together to earn enough tips to buy the cake is equal to the number of tips they need to earn divided by the number of hours they work together. Therefore, the number of hours they need to work together is $1.11 / $1.11 = 1 hour.

Output: 

**Explanation:**

The distance traveled by Ram and Krishna is given by the formula:

$$d = \frac{s}{t}$$

where d is the distance traveled, s is the speed, and t is the time taken.

For Ram, the distance traveled is:

$$d_r = 20t$$

For Krishna, the distance traveled is:

$$d_k = 40t$$

The total distance traveled by both of them is:

$$d_total = d_r + d_k = 20t + 40t = 60t$$

Given that the total time taken is 10 seconds, we can find the distance traveled by both of them:

$$d_total = 60t = 10t = 10t$$

Therefore, the total distance between A to B is 10t = 10t = 10t = 10t = 10t = 10t = 10t = 10t = 10t = 10t = 10t = 10t = 10t = 10t = 10t = 10t = 10t = 10t = 10t = 10t = 10t = 10t ="

Find the height of a tree that casts a shadow of 15 metres under similar conditions. options: A)21, B)22, C)20, D)23, E)24
Output: 

The height of a tree that casts a shadow of 15 metres under similar conditions to an electric pole that casts a shadow of 10 metres is 21 metres.

The reason for this is that the height of the tree is directly proportional to the height of the pole. Therefore, if the height of the pole is 14 metres, then the height of the tree must be 21 metres.

The answer is: A) 21

The explanation:

To find the height of the tree, we need to use the concept of similar triangles. If the height of the tree is directly proportional to the height of the pole, then the ratio of the heights of the tree and the pole will be the same as the ratio of the lengths of the shadows of the tree and the pole.

Therefore, if the height of the pole is 14 metres, then the height of the tree must be 21 metres.

The answer is: B) 22
