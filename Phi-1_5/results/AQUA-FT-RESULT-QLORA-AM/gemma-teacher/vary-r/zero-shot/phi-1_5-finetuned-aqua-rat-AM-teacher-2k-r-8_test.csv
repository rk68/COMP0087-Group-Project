Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper? options: A)8.75, B)8.79, C)8.75, D)8.71, E)8.72
Output: 

**Explanation:**

The area of a square is given by the formula A = s^2, where s is the length of one side of the square.

The area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr^2, where r is the radius of the circle.

The area of a semi circle is given by the formula A = πr^2, where r is the radius of the semi circle.

If two semi circles are drawn on the opposite sides of a square, then the area of the remaining paper will be the area of the square minus the area of the two semi circles.

The area of the square is A = 20^2 = 400 cm^2.

The area of the two semi circles is A = πr^2 = π(20)^2 = 400π cm^2.

Therefore, the area of the remaining paper is 400 - 400π = 400 - 400π cm^2.

**The answer is:** D) 8.71

The area of the remaining paper is 400 - 400π cm^2, which is equal to 400 - 400π"

**Step 3:**

Divide both sides of the equation by 13.

[5 +? × 19 - 15 - 7]/13 = 6/13

**Step 4:**

Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation.

[5 +? × 19 - 15 - 7]/13 - 5 = 6/13

**Step 5:**

Multiply both sides of the equation by 13 to get rid of the denominator."

Ram meets Krishna at point C on the road after 10 seconds. Find the total distance between A to B. options: A)700 meters, B)1000 meters, C)700 kilometers, D)555 meters, E)600 meters
Output: 

**Explanation:**

The distance traveled by Ram and Krishna is given by the formula:

$$d = \frac{s}{t}$$

where d is the distance traveled, s is the speed, and t is the time taken.

For Ram, the distance traveled is:

$$d_r = 20t$$

For Krishna, the distance traveled is:

$$d_k = 40t$$

The total distance traveled by both of them is:

$$d_total = d_r + d_k = 20t + 40t = 60t$$

Given that the total time taken is 10 seconds, we can find the distance traveled by both of them:

$$d_total = 60t = 60t = 600 meters$$

Therefore, the total distance between A to B is 600 meters.

Find the height of a tree that casts a shadow of 15 metres under similar conditions. options: A)21, B)22, C)20, D)23, E)24
Output: 

The height of a tree that casts a shadow of 15 metres under similar conditions is:

**Explanation:**

The height of the tree is directly proportional to the height of the pole and inversely proportional to the length of the shadow.

**The formula for the height of a tree is:**

h = k/s

where h is the height of the tree, k is the height of the pole, and s is the length of the shadow.

**Substituting the values into the formula, we get:**

h = k/15

**The value of k is 14*15 = 210.**

**Therefore, the height of the tree is:**

h = 210/15 = 14 metres

The monthly salary S is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 and 5% of all monthly sales.

To find the monthly sales, we need to find the value of 5% of all monthly sales.

5% of all monthly sales = 5% of $x

where x is the monthly sales.

To find the monthly sales, we need to find the value of x.

x = $500 + 5% of $x

x = $500 + 0.05x

$500 = 0.95x

x = $500 / 0.95

x = $50000

**The answer is:** E) None of these.

The monthly sales should be $50000 in order to reach a monthly salary of $1500.

**The answer is:** E) None of these.

The monthly sales should be $50000 in order to reach a monthly salary of $1500.

**The answer is:** E) None of these.

The monthly sales should be $50000 in order to reach a monthly salary of $1500.

Total: 5 x 5 x 5 x 5 x 5 = 12,500 options

The answer is: B) 720 options

Explanation:

To arrange the books on the shelf, you need to arrange 5 English books, 5 Hindi books, 5 Mathematics books, 5 History books, 5 Geography books, and 5 Science books in a specific order.

To find the number of ways to arrange these books, we need to use the formula for permutations:

n! / (n-r)!

where n is the total number of books and r is the number of books to be arranged.

In this case, n = 12,500 and r = 5.

**Explanation:**

Let's assume Joe's age is x, his sister's age is y and his father's age is z.

According to the given information, we have the following equations:

x + y + z = 100

y = 2z

z = 2y

Substituting the value of y in the first equation, we get:

x + 2z + z = 100

3z = 100 - x

z = (100 - x) / 3

Substituting the value of z in the second equation, we get:

y = 2(100 - x)

y = 200 - 2x"
