Instruction: You can purchase one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents, or two sodas and three energy bars for 300
cents. If the costs of the items do not change, compute the cost in cents of six sodas and seven bars. options: A)500, B)600, C)750, D)800, E)900
Output: 

If the cost of one soda is x cents, then the cost of two sodas is 2x cents.

If the cost of one energy bar is y cents, then the cost of three energy bars is 3y cents.

The total cost of six sodas and seven bars is 6x + 7y cents.

We know that the total cost is 150 cents, so we can write the equation:

6x + 7y = 150

To find the value of x and y, we need to solve for x and y.

One way to solve this equation is to use the fact that the cost of one soda is x cents and the cost of one energy bar is y cents.

If x = 200 cents, then the cost of two sodas is 2*200 = 400 cents.

If y = 300 cents, then the cost of three energy bars is 3*300 = 900 cents.

Therefore, the total cost of six sodas and seven bars is 400 + 900 = 1300 cents.

The answer is: E

The cost of six sodas and seven bars is 1300 cents.

The answer is: E

The cost of six sodas and seven bars is 1300 cents.

Instruction: Find the total no. of distinct bike no.'s that can beformed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s. How many letters need to be distinct? options: A)74453, B)64543, C)74325, D)65000, E)97656
Output: 

To form 2 letters followed by 2 no's, the total number of distinct bike no's that can be formed is given by the formula:

n(n+1) = n(n+1) - 1

where n is the number of distinct letters and n(n+1) is the total number of distinct bike no's that can be formed.

Substituting the values of n and n(n+1) into the formula, we get:

n(n+1) = n(n+1) - 1 = n(n+1) - n = n(n+1) - n

Therefore, the total number of distinct bike no's that can be formed is n(n+1) - n = n(n+1) - n = n(n+1) - n = n(n+1) - n = n(n+1) - n = n(n+1) - n = n(n+1) - n = n(n+1) - n = n(n+1) - n = n(n+1) - n = n(n+1) - n = n(n+1) - n = n(n+1) - n = n(n+1) - n = n(n+1) - n = n(n+1) - n = n(","Instruction: A cyclist travels at 12 miles per hour.

Instruction: Boomtown urban planners expect the city’s population to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year? options: A)20%, B)40%, C)50%, D)65%, E)75%
Output: 

The population of Boomtown is expected to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago.

To find the percent population increase, we need to calculate the percentage increase in population over one year.

Percentage increase = (Population increase / Population at the beginning of the year) * 100%

Percentage increase = (10% / Population at the beginning of the year) * 100%

If the population at the beginning of the year is 100, then the population increase is 10%.

Output: If ball A makes 2 rotations in 26 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 13 minutes. If ball B makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 7 minutes.
The two balls start rotating now and makes several rotations before they are at the SAME starting points. Ball A would have done a WHOLE number X of rotations and ball B would have done a WHOLE number Y of rotations. Also they would have rotated during the same period of time T. Hence
T = 13 X = 7 Y
Hence 13 X = 7 Y
Solve the above for X
X = 7 Y / 13
We want the time when they are FIRST at the same starting point. Therefore X and Y are the smallest whole numbers of the equation X = 7 Y / 13. The smallest value of Y that gives X as a whole number is 13. Hence
X = 7 (13) / 13 = 7
Time T is given by
T = 13 X = 13 * 7 = 91 minutes = 1 hour and 31 minutes

Instruction: A retailer sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00. For what price did the retailer sell the appliance? options: A)$27.30, B)$51.00, C)$63.00, D)$70.00, E)$91.00
Output: 

40% of cost is equal to $20.00, so the cost of the appliance is $20.00.

The selling price is equal to the cost plus the profit, which is $20.00 + $20.00 = $40.00.

The selling price is equal to the cost plus the profit, which is $40.00 + $20.00 = $60.00.

The selling price is equal to the cost plus the profit, which is $40.00 + $20.00 = $60.00.

The selling price is equal to the cost plus the profit, which is $40.00 + $20.00 = $60.00.

The selling price is equal to the cost plus the profit, which is $40.00 + $20.00 = $60.00.

The selling price is equal to the cost plus the profit, which is $40.00 + $20.00 = $60.00.

The selling price is equal to the cost plus the profit, which is $40.00 + $20.00 = $60.00.

The selling price is equal to the cost plus the profit, which is $40.00 + $20.00 = $60.00.

Instruction: there are more than 501 students in a school such that 20% of them exactly took physics and 28% of them exactly took math. What could be the least possible no of students in the school? options: A)550, B)570, C)600, D)700, E)none of these
Output: 

There are more than 501 students in a school such that 20% of them exactly took physics and 28% of them exactly took math.

The least possible no of students in the school is given by the formula:

n = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4)

where n is the number of students and x is the number of students who took physics.

Substituting the values of n and x into the formula, we get:

n = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4)

n = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4)

n = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4)

n = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4)

Instruction: A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point. options: A)238, B)289, C)200, D)287, E)187
Output: 

The speed of the ship is x miles per hour.

The speed of the plane is 10x miles per hour.

The distance traveled by the ship is 180 miles.

The distance traveled by the plane is 10x(180) = 1800 miles.

The total distance traveled is 180 + 1800 = 2160 miles.

The time taken by the ship to travel 180 miles is 180/x hours.

The time taken by the plane to travel 1800 miles is 1800/10x hours.

The time taken for them to meet is 180/x + 1800/10x = 2160/x hours.

The distance traveled by them is 2160 miles.

Therefore, the distance traveled by them is 2160/x = 2160/x = 2160 miles.

The distance traveled by the plane is 1800 miles.

The speed of the plane is 10x miles per hour.

The time taken by the plane to travel 1800 miles is 1800/10x hours.

The time taken for them to meet is 1800/10x + 1800/x = 2160/x hours.

The distance traveled by them is 1800 miles.

The speed of the ship is x miles per hour.

The time taken by the ship to travel 180 miles is 180/x hours.

The time taken for them to meet is 180/x + 1800/10x","Instruction: A father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan who are 23 and 24 at present.

Output: 

The population of a city increases by 5 % annually. So, in 2 years time, the population will increase by 5% of the current population.

The current population of the city is 78000. So, in 2 years time, the population will increase by 5% of 78000 = 78000 x 0.05 = 3900.

Therefore, the population of the city in 2 years time will be 78000 + 3900 = 85800.
