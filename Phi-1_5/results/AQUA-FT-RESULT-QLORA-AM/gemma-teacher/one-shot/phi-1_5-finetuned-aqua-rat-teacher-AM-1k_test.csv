If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm? options: A)50, B)70, C)75, D)100, E)125
Output: 

**Step 1: Calculate the number of files that are infected by a virus and a worm.**

The number of files that are infected by a virus and a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. Therefore, the number of files that are infected by a virus and a worm is 2.5 * 2 = 5.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of files that are NOT infected by a virus.**

If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, then the number of files that are NOT infected by a virus is 50% of the total number of files. Therefore, the number of files that are NOT infected by a virus is 50% of 250 = 125.

Instruction: Two ants are moving from their farms towards each other. Ant A is moving at a speed of 9 cm per hour and ant B is moving at a speed of 6 cm per hour. If the farms are 75 cm away from each other, what will be the distance (in cm) that ant A travels until meeting ant B? options: A)45, B)48, C)51, D)54, E)57
Output: 

The distance that ant A travels before meeting ant B is given by the formula:

Distance = Speed x Time

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:

Distance = 9 x Time

Since the distance between the farms is 75 cm, the time taken by ant A to travel this distance is:

Time = Distance / Speed

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:

Time = 75 / 9

Time = 8.33 hours

Therefore, the distance that ant A travels before meeting ant B is:

Distance = 9 x 8.33

Distance = 75.96 cm

The average speed of the plane around the field is given by the formula:

Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:

Average Speed = 75.96 / 8.33

Average Speed = 9.5 km/hr

Output: 

**Explanation:**

The number of coins that she brought is the number of coins that she got for each coin type.

For copper coins, she got 20 cents for each coin, so the number of coins that she brought is the number of coins that she got for copper coins divided by 20 cents.

For brass coins, she got 25 cents for each coin, so the number of coins that she brought is the number of coins that she got for brass coins divided by 25 cents.

The total number of coins that she brought is the sum of the number of coins that she got for copper coins and brass coins.

The total number of coins that she brought is the number of coins that she got for copper coins divided by 20 cents plus the number of coins that she got for brass coins divided by 25 cents.

The total number of coins that she brought is the number of coins that she got for copper coins divided by 20 cents plus the number of coins that she got for brass coins divided by 25 cents.

Instruction: 64 boys and 40 girls form a group for social work. During their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. How many members does the group have now, if the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3? options: A)277, B)288, C)200, D)277, E)168
Output: 

The ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, which means that for every 4 boys, there are 3 girls. Therefore, the number of boys in the group is 4/3 times the number of girls in the group.

The number of boys in the group is 4/3 times 40, which is equal to 160.

The total number of members in the group is 160 + 40, which is equal to 200.

The answer is: B

The probability of the man catching the first train is equal to the number of trains that come in a given time period divided by the total number of trains that come in a given time period.

The number of trains that come in a given time period is 10.

The total number of trains that come in a given time period is 10.

The probability of catching the first train is 10/10, which is equal to 1.

The answer is B) 1500p.

Explanation:

- The number of phones shipped is 4 crates x 1250 phones per crate = 5000 phones.
- The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. This means that the original retail price of an appliance was 120 percent of its wholesale cost.
- If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then the original retail price of an appliance was 80 percent of its wholesale cost.
- Therefore, the number of phones shipped is 5000 phones x 80 percent of its wholesale cost = 4000 phones.

Output: 

A) 40
B) 60
C) 70
D) 80
E) 90

The answer is E.

Explanation:

If 6 yrs are subtracted from the present age of Ajay and the remainder is divided by 18, then the present age of Rahul is obtained. If Rahul is 2 yrs younger to Denis whose age is 5 yrs, then the present age of Denis is 5 yrs + 2 yrs = 7 yrs. Therefore, the present age of Denis is 7 yrs / 18 = 40 yrs.

If the present age of Ajay is 40 yrs, then the present age of Rahul is 40 yrs - 6 yrs = 34 yrs.

If the present age of Denis is 40 yrs, then the present age of Ajay is 40 yrs - 7 yrs = 33 yrs.

If the present age of Denis is 40 yrs, then the present age of Rahul is 40 yrs - 2 yrs = 38 yrs.

If the present age of Denis is 40 yrs, then the present age of Ajay is 40 yrs - 2 yrs = 36 yrs","Instruction: The population of a city is 5265526. If there are 4169516 adults in the city, how many children are there in the city? options: A)1095961, B)1065961, C)1085961, D)1097961, E)1096061

Output: 

The formula to find the number of students who took physics is given by the equation:

n = 0.2n + 0.28n

where n is the number of students who took physics and n is the total number of students in the school.

To find the number of students who took math, we need to subtract the number of students who took physics from the total number of students in the school.

n = 0.2n + 0.28n - n

Simplifying the equation, we get:

n = 0.2n + 0.28n - n

n = 0.2n + 0.28n - n

n = 0.2n + 0.28n - n

n = 0.2n + 0.28n - n

n = 0.2n + 0.28n - n

n = 0.2n + 0.28n - n

Output: 

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = lw, where l is the length and w is the width. In this case, the area of the yard is 240 square meters, so we can write the equation A = lw = 240.

To find the length and width of the yard, we need to find the values of l and w that satisfy the equation A = lw.

We know that the length of the yard is 10 meters, so we can substitute l = 10 into the equation A = lw = 240.

240 = 10w
w = 24

Therefore, the width of the yard is 24 meters.

To find the total length of fencing needed, we need to find the perimeter of the yard. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2l + 2w, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

P = 2(10) + 2(24) = 40 + 48 = 88 meters

Therefore, Alice needs 88 meters of fencing.

The total number of presenters is 4 + 4 = 8.

The number of ways to choose 2 presenters from the team is given by the formula:

nCr = n! / (r!(n-r)!)

where n is the total number of presenters and r is the number of presenters to be chosen.

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:

nCr = 8! / (2!(8-2)!)

nCr = 8! / (2!6!)

nCr = 8! / (2!4!)

nCr = 8! / (2!2!)

nCr = 8! / (2!0!)

nCr = 8! / (2!1!)

Output: 

The formula for the monthly salary is S = 500 + 0.05S.

To find the monthly sales, we need to solve the equation S = 1500.

Substituting S = 500 + 0.05S into the equation, we get 1500 = 500 + 0.05S.

Subtracting 500 from both sides, we get 1000 = 0.05S.

Dividing both sides by 0.05, we get S = 20,000.

Output: 

The length of the ribbon was originally 30 cm. It was reduced in the ratio 5 : 3.

To find the length of the ribbon after reduction, we need to find the length of the ribbon after reduction in the ratio 5 : 3.

The length of the ribbon after reduction is given by the formula:

Length after reduction = Length before reduction * (1 - Reduction ratio)

Length after reduction = 30 * (1 - 3/5) = 18 cm

The minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 is $230.

John would make the 3-letter codes with diffenrent 5 vowels and 20 consonants with the condition that the middle letter must be vowel and the first letter and the third letter must be different from each other and are both consonant.

The number of different codes that can be made is given by the formula:

n(n-1)(n-2) / (n-1)(n-2)(n-3)

where n is the number of consonants in the code.

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:

n(n-1)(n-2) / (n-1)(n-2)(n-3) = 20(20-1)(20-1)(20-1) / (20-1)(20-1)(20-1)(20-1) = 20(19)(18)(17)(16) / (20-1)(20-1)(20-1)(20-1) = 20(19)(18)(17)(16)

Output: 

The answer is B) 3/2.

Explanation:

- Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as do two rolls.
- Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes do.
- Two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as how many pita breads?

To find the amount of falafel in one pita bread, we need to divide the amount of falafel in two rolls by the number of rolls.

The amount of falafel in one roll is 3/2 = 1.5.

Therefore, the amount of falafel in one pita bread is 1.5.

The total amount of falafel in six pita breads is 6 x 1.5 = 9.

The total amount of falafel in three rolls is 3 x 1.5 = 4.5.

The total amount of falafel in two baguettes is 2 x 1.5 = 3.

Therefore, the total amount of falafel in three rolls is 3 x 1.5 = 4.5.

Output: 

The distance traveled by a point on the edge of a fan blade that is rotating in a plane is given by the formula:

d = rt

where d is the distance traveled, r is the rate of rotation, and t is the time traveled.

In this case, the rate of rotation is 300 revolutions per minute, and the time traveled is 30 seconds. Therefore, the distance traveled is:

d = 300t

Instruction: Joe's age, Joe's sister's age and Joe’s fathers age sums up to 100. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Find the age of Joe's father? options: A)45, B)48, C)50, D)55, E)58
Output: 

Joe's age = 100 - (2 * sister's age) - (father's age - sister's age)

Substituting the values, we get:

100 - (2 * sister's age) - (father's age - sister's age) = 100

Solving for sister's age, we get:

2 * sister's age = 100 - father's age - sister's age

Sister's age = (100 - father's age - sister's age) / 2

Substituting the values, we get:

2 * sister's age = (100 - father's age - sister's age) / 2

Sister's age = (100 - father's age - sister's age) / 2

Substituting the values, we get:

2 * sister's age = (100 - father's age - sister's age) / 2

Sister's age = (100 - father's age - sister's age) / 2

Sister's age = (100 - father's age - sister's age) / 2

Instruction: The height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. The height of the room is: options: A)2.6m, B)3.9m, C)4m, D)4.2m, E)4.4m
Output: 

The height of the room is 2:5, which means that the height is 2/5 of the total height of the room. Therefore, the height of the room is 2/5 of the total height of the room, which is 2/5 * 2 = 0.4m.

The area of the room is 15 sq.m, which is equal to the width of the paper multiplied by the height of the room. Therefore, the area of the room is 50 * 0.4 = 20 sq.m.

The cost of paper is Rs.2 per meter, which means that the cost of paper is 20 * 2 = Rs.40.

Therefore, the cost of paper is Rs.40.

Output: 

The man spends 70% of his income, which means that he spends 100% - 70% = 30% of his income.

If his income increases by 20%, then his new income will be 100% + 20% = 120% of his original income.

Therefore, his new expenditure will be 30% of 120% of his original income, which is equal to 0.3 * 120% = 36%.

Output: 

The length of the rectangular piece is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth, which means that the length is 4 times the breadth plus 1m. Therefore, the length is 4 times the breadth plus 1m = 4b + 1m.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2l + 2w, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

Substituting the values of l and w into the formula, we get P = 2(4b + 1m) + 2w = 2(4b + 1m) + 2w = 8b + 2m + 2w.

Instruction: M = abc is a three digit number and N = cba, if M > N and M - N + 396c = 990. Then how many values of M are more than 300. options: A)20, B)30, C)40, D)200, E)None
Output: 

The given information is:

- M = abc
- N = cba
- M - N + 396c = 990

We know that M > N and M - N + 396c = 990.

To find the number of values of M that are more than 300, we need to find the values of M that satisfy the inequality M > N and M - N + 396c = 990.

We can do this by solving the inequality M - N + 396c = 990 for M.

M - N + 396c = 990
M = N + 396c

Now, we can substitute this value of M into the inequality M > N and M - N + 396c = 990.

M > N and M - N + 396c = 990
(N + 396c) > 990

We know that N + 396c is a three digit number.

Therefore, the number of values of M that are more than 300 is:

N + 396c > 300

We can substitute this value of N + 396c into the inequality M > N and M - N + 396c","Instruction: While selling a watch, a shopkeeper gives a discount of 5%.
