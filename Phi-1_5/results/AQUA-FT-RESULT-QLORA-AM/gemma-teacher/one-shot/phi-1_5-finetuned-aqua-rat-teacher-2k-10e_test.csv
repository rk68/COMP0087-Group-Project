Instruction: Boomtown urban planners expect the city’s population to increase by 10% per year over the next two years.

Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year? options: A)20%, B)40%, C)50%, D)65%, E)75%
Output: 

The question is asking how much of the mixture is to be removed and replaced with pure sand in order to make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand.

To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the percentage of sand in the mixture. 30% of the mixture is sand, and 70% of the mixture is clay. So, the total percentage of sand in the mixture is 30%.

Next, we need to calculate the percentage of sand in the mixture that is required to make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand. If we want to have equal quantities of clay and sand, then we need to remove and replace the same percentage of sand in the mixture.

Therefore, the percentage of sand in the mixture that is required to make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand is 30%.

The answer is: B

The answer is: 20%.

The mixture contains 20% sand and 70% clay, and in order to make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand, we need to remove and replace the same percentage of sand in the mixture.

Instruction: A coin made of alloy of aluminum and silver measures 2 x 15 mm (it is 2 mm thick and its diameter is 15 mm). If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum? options: A)36 grams, B)40 grams, C)42 grams, D)48 grams, E)50 grams
Output: 

The weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum is directly proportional to the volume of aluminum in the alloy. If the volume of aluminum in the alloy is equal to that of silver, then the weight of the coin will be twice that of the coin made of alloy with a thickness of 2 x 15 mm. Therefore, the total weight of the coin made of pure aluminum will be 36 grams.

The total weight of the coin made of alloy with a thickness of 2 x 15 mm will be 30 grams + 36 grams = 66 grams.

The percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is 100% - 20% = 80%. Therefore, the total deer population in the forest with tags will be 80% of the total deer population in the forest with tags.

The total deer population in the forest with tags will be 300 + 500 = 800 deer.

The total deer population in the forest will be 800 / 0.8 = 1000 deer.

Output: 

The given information is:

- Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes.
- Ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes.
- The ratio of the number of rotations is 3:5.

We know that the ratio of the number of rotations is 3:5, so we can write this as:

Question 8: A rectangular prism has a volume of 240 cubic centimeters and a height of 6 centimeters. If the length of the prism is 10 centimeters, what is the width of the prism?

Solution:
The volume of a rectangular prism is given by the formula V = lwh, where V is the volume, l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height. We know that V = 240, h = 6, and l = 10, so we can substitute these values into the formula to get 240 = 10w * 6. Solving for w, we get w = 4 centimeters.

Therefore, the width of the prism is 4 centimeters.

Output: 

**Step 1:** Calculate the cost price (CP) of the oranges.

P(A) = 0.2
P(B) = 0.8

So, the cost price (CP) is given by the formula:

CP = 450 * P(A) + 450 * P(B)

Substituting the values of P(A) and P(B) into the formula, we get:

450 * 0.2 + 450 * 0.8 = 90 * 7.50 = Rs. 5250

**Step 2:** Calculate the profit.

Profit = Selling price - Cost price

Profit = Rs. 7.50 * 90 = Rs. 6750

**Step 3:** Calculate the percentage gain.

Percentage gain = (Profit/Cost price) * 100%

Percentage gain = (Rs. 6750/Rs. 5250) * 100% = 100%

**The answer is:** A)50%

Therefore, the percentage gain of the merchant is 50%.

Output: 

The average score for the entire class is equal to y. The average score for the highest and lowest scorers is equal to x. Therefore, the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers is y – x.

In order to find the value of y – x, we need to find the value of y that makes y – x equal to z. This can be done by setting y – x = z and solving for y.

y – x = z
y = z + x

Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:

z = y + x

Therefore, the value of y that makes y – x equal to z is y + x.

The answer is: C) 36 minutes

The average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers is 36 minutes.

Output: 

The simple interest formula is given by the formula:

S.I. = P * R * T

where S.I. is the simple interest, P is the principal, R is the rate of interest, and T is the time period.

We know that P = Rs. 5000, R = 72/100, and T = 2 years. So, we need to find the value of S.I. to find the number of ties to take out.

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:

S.I. = 5000 * 72/100 * 2 = Rs. 1440

Since the rate of interest is 6%, the number of ties to take out is:

Number of ties = S.I. / R = Rs. 1440 / 6 = Rs. 240

Therefore, the answer is E.

Output: 

The formula for the volume of a rectangular solid is given by the formula V = lwh, where V is the volume, l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.

Given that the volume of the solid is 3 x 4 x 15, we can find the height of the solid by rearranging the formula as h = V/lw = 3 x 4 x 15/3 x 4 x 15 = 15.

Now that we know the height of the solid, we can find the diameter of the sphere using the formula d = 2h, where d is the diameter, h is the height, and we need to find the diameter of the sphere where all eight of its vertices are on the sphere.

Substituting the values of h and d into the formula, we get d = 2(15) = 30.

Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is 30.

Output: 

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of students in the class.**

The total number of students in the class is 50.

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of passing students.**

The average passing speed is 12 mph, so the number of passing students is 50 * 83 = 4450.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of failing students.**

The average failing speed is 13 mph, so the number of failing students is 50 * 55 = 2650.

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of students who passed.**

The total number of students who passed is 4450.

**Step 5: Calculate the total number of students in the class.**

The total number of students in the class is 4450 + 2650 = 8100.

**Step 6: Calculate the class average.**

The class average is 76, so the percentage of students who passed is (4450/8100) * 100% = 50%.

**The answer is:** E

Therefore, the answer is E.

**The answer is:** 50%

At what time will the two trains meet each other? options: A)12 am on the next day, B)5 am on the next day, C)5 pm on the next day, D)2 pm on the next day, E)None of these
Output: 

The ratio of rice, wheat and corn in the mixture is 2:3:5. If a bag of the mixture contains 3 pounds of rice, then the total weight of the mixture in pounds is 2x3x5 = 30 pounds.

Therefore, the total weight of the mixture in pounds that is not rice is 30 - 3 = 27 pounds.

The weight of corn in the mixture that is not rice is 27 pounds.

The time it takes for the two trains to meet each other is 27 pounds / 72 kmph = 0.375 hours.

Instruction: The ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which will fit inside the cube is? options: A)2: π, B)7:2, C)8:2, D)6: π, E)8:3
Output: 

**Step 1:** Find the volume of the cube.
The volume of a cube is given by the formula V = s^3, where V is the volume and s is the length of the side of the cube.

**Step 2:** Find the volume of the sphere.
The volume of a sphere is given by the formula V = (4/3)πr^3, where V is the volume and r is the radius of the sphere.

**Step 3:** Find the ratio of the volumes.
The ratio of the volumes is given by the formula V/V' = r/s, where V is the volume, V' is the volume of the sphere, r is the radius of the sphere, and s is the length of the side of the cube.

**Step 4:** Find the value of s.
To find the value of s, we need to find the value of r that makes the ratio of the volumes equal to the ratio of the volumes of the cube and the sphere.

**Step 5:** Solve for s.
Once we have found the value of s, we can find the distance between A and B.","Instruction: Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph.

Output: 

The distance traveled by a point on the edge of a fan blade that is rotating in a plane is directly proportional to the number of revolutions per minute. Therefore, the number of revolutions per second is 300.

After 30 seconds, the point will have traveled a total of 300 revolutions. If 40% of the employees take a winter and a summer vacation, then the remaining 60% will take a winter and a summer vacation. Therefore, the number of employees who take a winter and a summer vacation is 60% of the total number of employees, which is 75% of the total number of employees.

The distance traveled by a point on the edge of a fan blade that is rotating in a plane is directly proportional to the number of employees who take a winter and a summer vacation. Therefore, the distance traveled by the point is 75% of the distance traveled by the fan blade.

The distance traveled by the point is 75% of 10 centimeters, which is 7.5 centimeters.

Instruction: Joe's age, Joe's sister's age and Joe’s fathers age sums up to 100. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Find the age of Joe's father? options: A)45, B)48, C)50, D)55, E)58
Output: 

The perimeter of a rectangular plot is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where P is the perimeter, l is the length and w is the width.

Given that the perimeter is 340 metres and the rate of gardening is 10 per square metre, we can find the length and width of the plot as follows:

P = 2(l + w)
340 = 2(l + w)
l + w = 170

Now that we know the length and width of the plot, we can find the age of Joe's father as follows:

Joe's age = l
Father's age = l

When Joe is as old as his father, we can write:

l = l

Therefore, the age of Joe's father is 50.

The answer is: D)Cannot be determined.

**The answer is:** D)Cannot be determined. The information provided is not enough to find the age of Joe's father. We need to have more information, such as the relationship between Joe's age and his father's age, to find the age of Joe's father.

Output: 

The formula for the area of a trapezium is given by the formula A = (b + a)h/2, where A is the area, b and a are the bases, and h is the height.

We know that the area of cross-section is 640 square meters, the width of the canal is 10 m, and the depth of the canal is 6 m. So, we can substitute these values into the formula as follows:

640 = (6 + 10)h/2

To find the height, we need to isolate h on one side of the equation. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2 and then adding 6 to both sides of the equation:

2h = 640 + 6

2h = 616

Output: 

The first step is to find out how many marbles were pulled out in total. This is done by adding the number of marbles pulled out in the first time (20) to the number of marbles pulled out in the second time (20). This gives a total of 40 marbles pulled out.

The next step is to find out the percentage of black marbles in the bag. 1 marble was black out of the 20 marbles pulled out in the first time, so the percentage of black marbles in the bag is 1/20 = 0.05.

The percentage of black marbles in the bag is directly proportional to the number of marbles in the bag. Therefore, the number of marbles in the bag that represent their percentage in the bag is 0.05 * 100 = 5 marbles.

Instruction: The height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. The height of the room is: options: A)2.6m, B)3.9m, C)4m, D)4.2m, E)4.4m
Output: 

The area of the room is given by the formula A = (2/5)s*h, where A is the area, s is the width of the room, and h is its height.

If P can finish the job in 10 minutes, then the area of the room is equal to the area that can be covered by P in 10 minutes.

If Q can finish the job in 5 minutes, then the area of the room that can be covered by Q in 5 minutes is equal to half the area of the room.

Since both P and Q are eating simultaneously, the area of the room that can be covered by them in t minutes is equal to the sum of the area of the room that can be covered by P in t minutes and the area of the room that can be covered by Q in t minutes.

Therefore, the equation is:

2.6*t + 3.9*t = 15

Solving this equation for t, we get:

Instruction: A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure? options: A)58.3%, B)62.5%, C)63.5%, D)64.5%, E)65.5%
Output: 

The monthly salary S of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. So, we can write the equation as:

S = 500 + 0.05x

where S is the monthly salary and x is the monthly sales.

To find out the new monthly sales, we need to find the value of x that makes S = $1500.

Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

1500 = 500 + 0.05x

1500 - 500 = 0.05x

1000 = 0.05x

x = 2000

The new monthly sales are $2000.

**The answer is:** D

The monthly sales should be $2000 to reach a monthly salary of $1500.

**The answer is:** D) $2000

The total monthly sales are $2000.

**The answer is:** B) $62.5

The new monthly sales are $62.5.

Output: 

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangular piece is given by the formula:

Perimeter = 2(length + breadth)

We know that the length is 1m more than 4 times the breadth, so we can substitute this into the formula as:

Perimeter = 2(4(breadth) + breadth + 1)

Since the area of a rectangular piece is given by the formula:

Area = length x breadth

We also know that the area of the piece is 420 units, so we can substitute this into the formula as:

420 = 420

Therefore, the area of the piece is 420 square meters.

Now, we can substitute the area and the length into the formula for perimeter as:

Perimeter = 2(4(breadth) + breadth + 1)

Perimeter = 2(4(breadth) + 4(breadth) + 1)

Perimeter = 2(4(breadth) + 4(breadth) + 1)

Perimeter = 2(4(breadth) + 4(breadth) + 1)

Output: 

The distance travelled by the first car is 55 mph, which is equivalent to 10 miles per hour. Therefore, the time taken by the first car to cover a distance of 10 miles is 10 miles per hour.

The distance travelled by the second car is 52 mph, which is equivalent to 10 miles per hour. Therefore, the time taken by the second car to cover a distance of 10 miles is 10 miles per hour.

Since the two cars are travelling in the same direction, the time taken by both cars to cover the same distance will be equal. Therefore, the time taken by both cars to cover a distance of 10 miles will be 10 hours.

The actual distance travelled by the first car is 10 miles per hour, therefore the time taken by the first car to cover a distance of 10 miles is 10 hours.

Output: 

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of the milk tea:**

The cost of the milk tea is 40% of the selling price, which is $70.00. So, the cost of the milk tea is $70.00 x 40% = $28.00.

**Step 2: Calculate the gross profit:**

The gross profit is $20.00.

**Step 3: Calculate the revenue from selling the milk tea:**

The revenue from selling the milk tea is $70.00 x 15% = $10.50.

**Step 4: Calculate the total profit:**

The total profit is $10.50 - $28.00 = -$18.50.

**Step 5: Calculate the final concentration of tea:**

The final concentration of tea is 10% of the total solution, which is $28.00. So, the final concentration of tea is $28.00 x 10% = $2.80.

**The answer is:** D) $62.35

The final concentration of tea John drinks is $62.35.
