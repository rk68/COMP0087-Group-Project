Output: 

The time taken to construct a wall is directly proportional to the number of workers. If the number of workers is increased, the time taken to construct the wall will decrease.

The time taken to construct a wall is given by the formula:

Time = (Number of workers) x (Time taken by one worker)

If the number of workers is increased, the time taken to construct the wall will decrease.

Therefore, the time taken to construct a wall is:

Time = (Number of workers) x (Time taken by one worker)

Time = (Number of workers) x (45/40)

Time = (Number of workers) x (1.125)

Time = (Number of workers) x (1.125)

Time = (Number of workers) x (1.125)

Time = (Number of workers) x (1.125)

Time = (Number of workers) x (1.125)

Instruction: Two ants are moving from their farms towards each other. Ant A is moving at a speed of 9 cm per hour and ant B is moving at a speed of 6 cm per hour. If the farms are 75 cm away from each other, what will be the distance (in cm) that ant A travels until meeting ant B? options: A)45, B)48, C)51, D)54, E)57
Output: 

The distance that ant A travels before meeting ant B is given by the formula:

Distance = Speed x Time

The time taken by ant A to meet ant B is given by the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Substituting the values, we get:

Time = 75 / 9 = 8.33 hours

The distance that ant A travels before meeting ant B is:

Distance = 8.33 x 9 = 75.96 cm

The distance that ant B travels before meeting ant A is:

Distance = 75 / 6 = 12.5 cm

The average speed of the plane around the field is:

Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time

Total Distance = 75 + 12.5 = 87.5 cm

Total Time = 8.33 + 12.5 = 19.83 hours

Average Speed = 87.5 / 19.83 = 4.62 km/hr

Output: 

The formula for simple interest is given by:

I = P * r * t

where I is the interest, P is the principal, r is the rate of interest, and t is the time period.

In this case, we know that the principal is Rs. 5000, the interest is Rs. 300, and the time period is 3 years.

So, we can substitute these values into the formula and solve for the rate of interest:

300 = 5000 * r * 3

r = 300 / (5000 * 3)

r = 0.06

Therefore, the rate of interest per annum is 6%.

Instruction: A retailer sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00. For what price did the retailer sell the appliance? options: A)$27.30, B)$51.00, C)$63.00, D)$70.00, E)$91.00
Output: 

The retailer sold the appliance for $20.00, which is 40 percent above the cost. Therefore, the gross profit is $20.00.

The gross profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost price. In this case, the selling price is $20.00, and the cost price is the cost of the appliance.

The cost of the appliance is the selling price minus the gross profit. Therefore, the cost of the appliance is $20.00 - $20.00 = $0.00.

The retailer sold the appliance for $0.00, which is the least possible no of students in the school.

Output: 

Explanation:

If 20% of the students took physics, then the number of students who took physics is 20% of the total number of students.

If 28% of the students took math, then the number of students who took math is 28% of the total number of students.

The total number of students is the sum of the number of students who took physics and the number of students who took math.

Therefore, the number of students who took physics is 20% of the total number of students, which is 20% of the total number of students.

The number of students who took math is 28% of the total number of students, which is 28% of the total number of students.

The total number of students is the sum of the number of students who took physics and the number of students who took math, which is 20% of the total number of students plus 28% of the total number of students.

Therefore, the number of students who took physics is 20% of the total number of students plus 28% of the total number of students, which is 20% of the total number of students plus 28% of the total number of students.","Instruction: If n is such that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, then x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4) satisfies options: A)20 < x < 54, B)23 < x < 58, C)25 < x < 64, D)28 < x < 60, E)None of these

Output: 

Explanation:

The average score for the entire class is equal to y, so the sum of the highest and lowest scores is equal to z. Therefore, the sum of the scores of all the students in the class is equal to zy.

The average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers is equal to (zy – 2x)/z.

Substituting the value of zy and z into the equation, we get:

(zy – 2x)/z = (z – 2)/z

Simplifying the equation, we get:

(zy – 2x)/z = z – 2

Multiplying both sides by z, we get:

zy – 2x = zz – 2z

Subtracting zz from both sides, we get:

zy – 2x = z – 2

Therefore, the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers is equal to z – 2.

The answer is: C

Output: 

The height of the tree is 22 metres.

Explanation:

The ratio of the height of the pole to the height of the tree is 14:22, which simplifies to 1:2.

Therefore, the height of the tree is 2 times the height of the pole, which is 21 metres.

The area of the tree is the product of its height and the length of its shadow, which is 22 metres times 15 metres, which is 330 square metres.

The area of the pole is the product of its height and the length of its shadow, which is 14 metres times 10 metres, which is 140 square metres.

The difference between the areas of the tree and the pole is 330 square metres minus 140 square metres, which is 200 square metres.

Therefore, the height of the tree is 200 square metres.

Output: 

The monthly salary S of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales.

To find the monthly sales, we need to solve the equation:

S = 500 + 0.05S

where S is the monthly salary and S is the monthly sales.

We want S to be $1500, so we need to solve for S:

1500 = 500 + 0.05S

1500 - 500 = 0.05S

1000 = 0.05S

S = 1000 / 0.05

S = $20,000

Therefore, the monthly sales should be $20,000 so that her monthly salary reaches $1500.

Output: 

Train A leaves every 16 minutes, so in 1 hour, it will have traveled 16 x 60 = 960 cm.

Train B leaves every 17 minutes, so in 1 hour, it will have traveled 17 x 60 = 1020 cm.

The total distance traveled by both trains in 1 hour is 960 + 1020 = 1720 cm.

The distance between the farms is 75 cm, so the distance traveled by ant A until meeting ant B is 1720 - 75 = 1485 cm.

of 55. If the overall class average was 76, what percent of the class passed? options: A)44%, B)66%, C)68%, D)72%, E)75%
Output: 

The passing students had an average of 83, while the failing students had an average of 55. The overall class average was 76.

To find the percentage of the class that passed, we need to find the total number of students in the class and the number of students who passed.

The total number of students in the class is the sum of the number of passing students and the number of failing students.

Total number of students = Number of passing students + Number of failing students

Total number of students = 83 + 55 = 128

The number of students who passed is the number of passing students.

Number of students who passed = Number of passing students

Number of students who passed = 83

The percentage of the class that passed is the number of students who passed divided by the total number of students in the class multiplied by 100.

Percentage of the class that passed = (Number of students who passed / Total number of students) x 100

Percentage of the class that passed = (83 / 128) x 100

Percentage of the class that passed = 66.25%

Instruction: The ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which will fit inside the cube is? options: A)2: π, B)7:2, C)8:2, D)6: π, E)8:3
Output: 

The ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which will fit inside the cube is:

V_cube/V_sphere = V_sphere/V_cube

where V_cube is the volume of the cube and V_sphere is the volume of the sphere.

The volume of the sphere is given by:

V_sphere = (4/3)πr^3

where r is the radius of the sphere.

The ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which will fit inside the cube is:

V_cube/V_sphere = V_sphere/V_cube

= (4/3)πr^3/r^3

= 4/3π

Output: 

The distance traveled by a point on the edge of a fan blade that is rotating in a plane is given by the formula:

d = rt

where d is the distance traveled, r is the rate of rotation, and t is the time traveled.

In this case, the rate of rotation is 300 revolutions per minute, and the time traveled is 30 seconds.

To convert the time traveled to minutes, we need to divide it by 60:

t = 30 / 60 = 0.5 minutes

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:

d = 300 * 0.5 = 150 centimeters

Therefore, the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade is 150 centimeters.

Output: 

Joe's age: x
Joe's sister's age: x
Joe's father's age: 2x

The sum of their ages is 100, so:

x + x + 2x = 100

3x = 100

x = 33.33

Joe's father's age is:

2x = 2(33.33) = 66.66

When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. This means that Joe's sister's age is equal to 2 times Joe's age.

When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's father will be twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. This means that Joe's father's age is equal to 2 times Joe's sister's age.

The height of the room is 2:5, which means that the height is 2/5 of the total height of the room. Therefore, the height of the room is 2/5 of the total height of the room, which is 2/5 * 2 = 0.4m.

The area of the walls of the room is given by the formula: A = 2lw + 2lh, where l is the length of the room and h is the height of the room.

Substituting the values of l and h, we get: A = 2 * 2 * 50 + 2 * 0.4 * 50 = 300 sq.m.

The cost of paper for the walls of the room is given by the formula: C = 2lw * Rs.2, where l is the length of the room and Rs.2 is the cost of paper per meter.

Substituting the values of l and Rs.2, we get: C = 2 * 2 * 50 * Rs.2 = Rs.260.

Therefore, the cost of paper for the walls of the room is Rs.260.

Instruction: M = abc is a three digit number and N = cba, if M > N and M - N + 396c = 990. Then how many values of M are more than 300. options: A)20, B)30, C)40, D)200, E)None
Output: 

The given information is:

M = abc
N = cba

The equation is:

M - N + 396c = 990

To find the value of c, we need to isolate c in the equation.

M - N = 396c

Subtracting N from both sides, we get:

M = 396c

Now, we can substitute the value of M into the equation to find the value of c.

396c - N = 990

Subtracting 396c from both sides, we get:

-N = 990 - 396c

Multiplying both sides by -1, we get:

N = -990 + 396c

Now, we can substitute the value of N into the equation to find the value of c.

M - N = 396c

-990 + 396c = 990

Subtracting 396c from both sides, we get:

-990 = 990 - 396c

Subtracting 990 from both sides, we get:

-990 = 396c
