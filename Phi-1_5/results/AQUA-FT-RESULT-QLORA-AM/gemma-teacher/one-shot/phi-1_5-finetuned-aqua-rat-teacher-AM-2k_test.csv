Instruction: You can purchase one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents, or two sodas and three energy bars for 300
cents. If the costs of the items do not change, compute the cost in cents of six sodas and seven bars. options: A)500, B)600, C)750, D)800, E)900
Output: 

The cost of one soda is 150 cents, and the cost of two energy bars is 300 cents. Therefore, the cost of six sodas is 6 * 150 = 900 cents.

The cost of two sodas is 2 * 150 = 300 cents. Therefore, the cost of seven energy bars is 7 * 300 = 2100 cents.

The total cost of six sodas and seven energy bars is 900 + 2100 = 3000 cents.

The cost of six sodas and seven energy bars is 3000 cents.

Output: 

**Explanation:**

To form a distinct bike no. using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s, we need to choose 2 letters from a total of 26 letters and 2 no.'s from a total of 2 no.'s.

**Step 1:** Choose 2 letters from 26 letters.

There are 26 letters in total, so the number of distinct letters that can be formed is 26C2 = 26.

**Step 2:** Choose 2 no.'s from 2 no.'s.

There are 2 no.'s in total, so the number of distinct no.s that can be formed is 2C2 = 2.

Output: 

**Explanation:**

To reach a salary of at least $1000, the sales person must make a total of at least $1000 in sales.

To find the number of sales required to reach a salary of at least $1000, we need to divide the salary by the commission rate.

The commission rate is 10%, which means that for each sale, the sales person will earn 10% of the sale price as commission.

To find the number of sales required to reach a salary of at least $1000, we need to divide the salary by the commission rate.

$1000 / 10% = 1000 sales

Therefore, the sales person must make a total of 1000 sales in order to reach a salary of at least $1000.

Instruction: 64 boys and 40 girls form a group for social work. During their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. How many members does the group have now, if the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3? options: A)277, B)288, C)200, D)277, E)168
Output: 

The ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, which means that for every 4 boys, there are 3 girls. So, if there are a total of 64 boys and 40 girls, then the number of boys in the group is 4/7 of the total number of members. Therefore, the number of boys in the group is 4/7 * 64 = 32.

The number of girls in the group is 3/7 of the total number of members, which is 3/7 * 40 = 12.

The total number of members in the group is 32 + 12 = 44.

Therefore, the probability of the man catching the first train is 44/64 = 0.75.

Instruction: If a man rows at the rate of 4 kmph in still water and his rate against the current is 2 kmph, then the man's rate along the current is: options: A)15 kmph, B)6 kmph, C)12 kmph, D)14 kmph, E)6 kmph
Output: 

The capacity of a tank of dimensions (8 m × 6 m × 2.5 m) is 120 litres.

The man's rate against the current is 2 kmph.

Therefore, the man's rate along the current is:

2 kmph - 4 kmph = -2 kmph

The negative sign indicates that the man is moving against the current.

The formula for the rate of a moving object is:

Rate = Distance/Time

The distance is the product of the dimensions of the tank, which is 8 m × 6 m × 2.5 m = 120 m.

The time is the product of the speed and the time, which is 120 m/2 kmph = 60 seconds.

Therefore, the rate of the man is:

Rate = 120 m/60 s = 2 kmph

The answer is: D

The answer is: The capacity of a tank of dimensions (8 m × 6 m × 2.5 m) is 120 litres. The man's rate against the current is 2 kmph.

Output: 

**Explanation:**

Given information:
n = 36, x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4)

We know that the number of students who took physics is 20% of the total number of students, which is 20% of 36 = 0.2 * 36 = 7.2.

Similarly, the number of students who took math is 28% of the total number of students, which is 28% of 36 = 0.28 * 36 = 8.4.

Therefore, the number of students who took physics and math is 7.2 + 8.4 = 15.6.

The least possible number of students in the school is the number of students who took physics and math, which is 15.6.

Output: 

**Explanation:**

1. Calculate the distance traveled by Ram and Krishna in 10 seconds.
Distance traveled by Ram = 20m/s * 10s = 200 meters
Distance traveled by Krishna = 40m/s * 10s = 400 meters

2. Find the relative speed of Ram and Krishna.
Relative speed = 20m/s + 40m/s = 60m/s

3. Calculate the time taken by Ram and Krishna to meet each other.
Time taken = 10s

4. Find the distance traveled by Ram and Krishna before meeting each other.
Distance traveled by Ram = 200 meters
Distance traveled by Krishna = 400 meters

Output: 

The formula for the height of a tree is given by the formula:

h = 2s/h

where h is the height of the tree, s is the height of the pole, and h is the height of the shadow.

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:

h = 2(15)/10 = 3 metres

Therefore, the height of the tree is 3 metres.

The area of the sheet is given by the formula:

A = lw

where A is the area of the sheet, l is the length of the sheet, and w is the width of the sheet.

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:

A = l(l) = l^2

Substituting the value of l into the formula, we get:

l^2 = l(l) = l^2

Therefore, the area of the sheet is l^2.

The area of the sheet is equal to the area of the tree, which is 15 square metres.

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = lw, where A is the area, l is the length, and w is the width.

We know that the area of the yard is 240 square meters, so we can write the equation as:

240 = 10w

Solving for w, we get:

w = 24

Therefore, the length of the yard is 24 meters.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2l + 2w, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

Substituting the value of w into the formula, we get:

Output: 

**Explanation:**

To obtain the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and vitamin A, the health food must contain at least 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A.

To calculate the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E, we need to find the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E per gram of health food. This can be done by dividing the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E by the percentage of vitamin E in the health food.

Minimum daily requirement of vitamin E per gram of health food = 9% / 0.09 = 100 grams

To calculate the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A, we need to find the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A per gram of health food. This can be done by dividing the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A by the percentage of vitamin A in the health food.

Minimum daily requirement of vitamin A per gram of health food = 8% / 0.08 = 125 grams

Therefore, the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and vitamin A is 100 grams and 125 grams, respectively.

**The answer is:** A) 15

Output: 

The monthly salary S of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. To find the monthly sales, we need to solve the equation:

S = 500 + 0.05S

where S is the monthly salary and 0.05S is the monthly sales.

We want to find the value of S that makes S = $1500, so we need to find the value of S that satisfies the equation:

1500 = 500 + 0.05S

S = $3000

Output: 

The original length of the ribbon was 30 cm. It was reduced in the ratio 5 : 3.

To find the length of the ribbon after reduction, we need to find the new length in terms of the original length.

The new length is given by the formula:

New length = Original length * (Reduction ratio / (Reduction ratio + 1))

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:

New length = 30 * (5 / (5 + 3)) = 18

Therefore, the length of the ribbon after reduction is 18 cm.

The ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which will fit inside the cube is V/V_sphere = s^3/r^3.

If V_sphere is equal to the volume of the sphere, then the ratio of the volumes of the cube to that of the sphere is V/V_sphere = s^3/r^3.

If V_sphere is greater than the volume of the sphere, then the ratio of the volumes of the cube to that of the sphere is V/V_sphere = s^3/r^3.

If V_sphere is less than the volume of the sphere, then the ratio of the volumes of the cube to that of the sphere is V/V_sphere = s^","Instruction: Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph.

Output: 

The points A,B,C,D,E and F form a regular pentagon. To form a quadrilateral, we need to choose 4 points from the pentagon.

The number of ways to choose 4 points from the pentagon is given by the formula:

nC4 = n! / (4!(n-4)!)

where n is the number of points in the pentagon.

Substituting the values of n into the formula, we get:

nC4 = 5! / (4!(5-4)!) = 5! / (4!1!) = 5

Therefore, the total number of quadrilaterals that can be formed by joining 4 of the points A,B,C,D,E and F is 5.

Instruction: Joe's age, Joe's sister's age and Joe’s fathers age sums up to 100. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Find the age of Joe's father? options: A)45, B)48, C)50, D)55, E)58
Output: 

Joe's age = 100 - (2 * Sister's age)

Sister's age = 100 - (2 * Father's age)

Father's age = 2 * Sister's age

Substituting the values of Sister's age and Father's age in the equation, we get:

100 - (2 * Father's age) = 2 * Sister's age

Father's age = 2 * Sister's age - 100

Substituting the value of Sister's age in the equation, we get:

Father's age = 2 * (100 - Sister's age) - 100

Father's age = 2 * 100 - 2 * Sister's age

Father's age = 200 - 2 * Sister's age

Therefore, the cost of gardening 1-metre – broad boundary around a rectangular plot having perimeter of 340 metres at the rate of 10 per square metre is:

Father's age = 200 - 2 * Sister's age

The cost of gardening 1-metre – broad boundary around a rectangular plot having perimeter of 340 metres at the rate of 10 per square metre is:

Cost = 200 - 2 * Sister's age

Output: 

**Explanation:**

1. Arrange the children on the chairs in a straight line.
2. Susan is on the left of Tim.
3. There are 3 ways to arrange the children on the chairs.

**The answer is:** D

The total number of ways to arrange the children on the chairs is 3! = 6.

The number of ways to arrange the children on the chairs so that Susan is on the left of Tim is 3! - 1 = 6.

Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange the children on the chairs is 6.

The price at which the retailer sold the appliance is $63.00.

**The answer is:** C

The total cost of the appliance is $20.00.

Output: 

**Step 1: Calculate the savings per issue:**

Savings per issue = 25% of cover price = 0.25 * cover price

**Step 2: Calculate the cost per issue:**

Cost per issue = cover price - savings per issue = $42.00 - 0.25 * cover price

**Step 3: Substitute the value of the perimeter into the formula:**

$340 = $42.00 - 0.25 * cover price

**Step 4: Solve for the cover price:**

$340 = $42.00 - 0.25 * cover price
$42.00 = $42.00 + 0.25 * cover price
$42.00 - $42.00 = 0.25 * cover price
$0 = 0.25 * cover price

**Step 5: Calculate the cover price:**

$0 = 0.25 * cover price
$0 = 0

Output: 

The length of the rectangular piece is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth. So, the length is 4 times the breadth plus 1m.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:

Perimeter = 2(length + breadth)

Substituting the values of length and breadth into the formula, we get:

Perimeter = 2(4(breadth) + 1m)

Perimeter = 2(4(breadth) + 4m)
