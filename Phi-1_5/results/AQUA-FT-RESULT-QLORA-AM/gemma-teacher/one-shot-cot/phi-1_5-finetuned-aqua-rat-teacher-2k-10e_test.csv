Instruction: You can purchase one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents, or two sodas and three energy bars for 300
cents. If the costs of the items do not change, compute the cost in cents of six sodas and seven bars. options: A)500, B)600, C)750, D)800, E)900
Output: 
If each soda costs 150 cents, then six sodas will cost 6*150 = 900 cents.
If each energy bar costs 300 cents, then seven energy bars will cost 7*300 = 2100 cents.
Therefore, the total cost of six sodas and seven energy bars is 900 + 2100 = 3000 cents.

The answer is: B) Rs 500

**Note:** The cost of the items does not change, but the number of items purchased changes. Therefore, the cost of the items increases by 300 cents.



Question 8: A rectangular prism has a volume of 240 cubic centimeters. If the length is 6 centimeters and the width is 4 centimeters, what is the height of the prism?

Solution:
The volume of a rectangular prism is given by the formula: V = lwh, where V is the volume, l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.
Substituting the values of l, w, and V into this formula, we get: 240 = 6h x 4h x h.
To solve for h, we need to isolate h on one side of the equation. First, we can multiply both sides by 4h to get: 240 = 6h^2 x 4h.
Then, we can divide both sides by 6h^2 to get: 40 = 4h.
Finally, we can divide both sides by 4 to get: h","Instruction: A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews.

Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year? options: A)20%, B)40%, C)50%, D)65%, E)75%
Output: 

The population increase over the last year is 20%.

**The answer is:** B

The population increase over the last year is 20%.

**The explanation is:**

The population increase over the last year is 20%. This is because the population is expected to increase by 10% per year over the next two years, and the population increase is directly proportional to the time elapsed.

**The answer is:** B

The answer is B because the ratio of sand to clay is 7:3, and the amount of sand removed is 6/7 of the total mixture. Therefore, the remaining mixture would be 2 - 6/7 = 20/7 of the total mixture.

**The answer is:** B

The answer is B because the ratio of sand to clay is 7:3, and the amount of sand removed is 6/7 of the total mixture. Therefore, the remaining mixture would be 2 - 6/7 = 20/7 of the total mixture.

Instruction: A coin made of alloy of aluminum and silver measures 2 x 15 mm (it is 2 mm thick and its diameter is 15 mm). If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum? options: A)36 grams, B)40 grams, C)42 grams, D)48 grams, E)50 grams
Output: 

The weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy is equal to the volume of silver in the alloy. Therefore, the volume of silver in the pure aluminum coin will be 2 x 15 mm x 2 = 30 mm³. The density of silver is 2 g/cm³ and the mass of the pure aluminum coin will be 30 mm³ x 2 g/cm³ = 60 grams.

The percent of the total weight of the pure aluminum coin that is silver is: 60/30 = 2/3 = 66.67%

The total weight of the coin is 30 grams. Therefore, the total number of coins that weigh 30 grams is 66.67% of the total number of coins in the alloy. The total number of coins in the alloy is N.

The total number of coins that weigh 30 grams is: N = (30/2.5) x (500/20) = 75000

The total number of coins in the alloy is 75000.

The total number of coins in the alloy is 75000.

If the farms are 75 cm away from each other, what will be the distance (in cm) that ant A travels until meeting ant B? options: A)45, B)48, C)51, D)54, E)57
Output: 
The distance that ant A travels is equal to the speed of ant A multiplied by the time taken to meet ant B.
Time taken to meet ant B = 75/9 = 8.33 hours
Distance traveled by ant A = 9 * 8.33 = 75 cm
The distance that ant A travels is 75 cm.

The distance that ant B travels is equal to the speed of ant B multiplied by the time taken to meet ant A.
Time taken to meet ant A = 75/6 = 12.5 hours
Distance traveled by ant B = 6 * 12.5 = 75 cm
The distance that ant B travels is 75 cm.

The distance that ant A travels is equal to the sum of the distances traveled by ant A and ant B.
Distance traveled by ant A = 75 cm
Distance traveled by ant B = 75 cm
The distance that ant A travels is 75 cm.

The distance that ant A travels is equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of the distances traveled by ant A and ant B.
Distance traveled by ant A = √(75^2 + 75^2) = √(5625 + 5625) = √(12500) = 125 cm
The distance that ant A travels is 125 cm.

Output: If ball A makes 2 rotations in 26 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 13 minutes. If ball B makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 7 minutes.
The two balls start rotating now and makes several rotations before they are at the SAME starting points. Ball A would have done a WHOLE number X of rotations and ball B would have done a WHOLE number Y of rotations. Also they would have rotated during the same period of time T. Hence
T = 13 X = 7 Y
Hence 13 X = 7 Y
Solve the above for X
X = 7 Y / 13
We want the time when they are FIRST at the same starting point. Therefore X and Y are the smallest whole numbers of the equation X = 7 Y / 13. The smallest value of Y that gives X as a whole number is 13. Hence
X = 7 (13) / 13 = 7

Output: 

The formula for the length of a line segment is given by the formula:

$$L = \sqrt{(RS - T)^2 + (RT - U)^2 + (ST - U)^2}$$

Substituting the values of RS, RT, and ST into the formula, we get:

$$L = \sqrt{(5 - 0)^2 + (17 - 0)^2 + (22 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{25 + 17 + 22} = \sqrt{57}$$

Therefore, the length of line segment RU is $\sqrt{57}$.

The formula for simple interest is given by the formula:

S = P * R * T

where S is the simple interest, P is the principal, R is the rate of interest, and T is the time period.

We know that S = Rs. 5000, R = 2%, and T = 3 years. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

300 = 5000 * 2 * 3

300 = 3000

Instruction: If a man rows at the rate of 4 kmph in still water and his rate against the current is 2 kmph, then the man's rate along the current is: options: A)15 kmph, B)6 kmph, C)12 kmph, D)14 kmph, E)6 kmph
Output: 

The formula for the rate of flow is given by the formula:

$$R_f = \frac{V_t}{V_s}$$

where R_f is the rate of flow, V_t is the volume of water flowing in the tank per unit time, V_s is the volume of water in the tank, and t is the time taken to row.

We know that the man rows at the rate of 4 kmph in still water and his rate against the current is 2 kmph. So, the time taken to row in still water is given by the formula:

$$t_s = \frac{V_t}{V_s}$$

where t_s is the time taken to row in still water, V_t is the volume of water flowing in the tank per unit time, and V_s is the volume of water in the tank.

Substituting the values of V_t and t_s into the formula for rate of flow, we get:

$$R_f = \frac{120}{2} = 60 kmph$$

Therefore, the answer is E.

The answer is: The capacity of the tank is 120000 litres, E).

Output: 

The son receives Rs 5, the nephews receive Rs 2, and the daughters receive Rs 4. So, the total amount to be divided is Rs 8600.

Since each nephew receives Rs 2, the total number of nephews is Rs 8600/Rs 2 = Rs 4400.

Since each daughter receives Rs 4, the total number of daughters is Rs 4400/Rs 4 = Rs 1150.

Therefore, the total amount received by the daughters is Rs 1150.

Question 8: A rectangular prism has a volume of 240 cubic centimeters and a height of 6 centimeters. If the length of the prism is 10 centimeters, what is the width of the prism?

Solution:
The volume of a rectangular prism is given by the formula V = lwh, where V is the volume, l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height. We know that V = 240, h = 6, and l = 10, so we can substitute these values into the formula to get 240 = 10w * 6. Solving for w, we get w = 4 centimeters.

Therefore, the width of the prism is 4 centimeters.

Output: 

The ship traveled 180 miles and the plane traveled 10 times the speed of the ship, which is 10x180 = 1800 miles per hour.

⇒The distance they meet is equal to the speed of the ship multiplied by the time they have been traveling.

⇒Therefore, the time they have been traveling is 180/10 = 18 hours.

⇒The distance they meet is equal to the speed of the ship multiplied by the time they have been traveling, which is 180 miles per hour x 18 hours = 3240 miles.

⇒The distance they meet is equal to the distance traveled by the plane, which is 3240 miles.

⇒So, the distance when they meet is 3240 miles.

What is the speed of the elevator? options: A)1 step/minute, B)2 step/minute, C)3 step/minute, D)4 step/minute, E)None of the above
Output: 

We know that the time taken to reach the ground is inversely proportional to the number of steps taken. So, if we take 10 steps, the time taken will be 20 minutes. If we take 20 steps, the time taken will be 10 minutes. Therefore, the number of steps taken is 20 steps.

Output: 

The formula to find the sum of 40 and 1/3 of a number is:

S = 2/3 * n + 40

where S is the sum, n is the number, and 2/3 is the fractional part of the number.

Substituting this formula into the above formula, we get:

100 = 2/3 * n + 40

To find the value of n, we need to isolate n on one side of the equation:

2/3 * n = 100 - 40

n = (100 - 40) * 3/2

n = 60

Therefore, the number is 60.

Instruction: The monthly salary S of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. What should the monthly sales be so that her monthly salary reaches $1500? options: A)$50000, B)$40000, C)$30000, D)$20000, E)None of these
Output: 

The fixed salary is $500, so the remaining salary is $1500 - $500 = $1000.

The sales are 5% of all monthly sales, so the monthly sales should be $1000 × 5% = $50.

Therefore, the monthly sales should be $50 to reach a monthly salary of $1500.

The answer is: B

The answer is: $40000 + 20 = $20,000



Question 1: A store sells apples for $0.50 each and oranges for $0.75 each. If a customer buys 3 apples and 2 oranges, how much does the customer spend in total?

Solution:
The cost of 3 apples is 3 x $0.50 = $1.50
The cost of 2 oranges is 2 x $0.75 = $1.50

At what time will the two trains meet each other? options: A)12 am on the next day, B)5 am on the next day, C)5 pm on the next day, D)2 pm on the next day, E)None of these
Output: 

The formula to find the time taken by a train to cover a distance is given by the formula:

Time taken = Distance/Speed

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:

Time taken by ‘A’ = 3/40 = 0.075 hours

Time taken by ‘B’ = 3/72 = 0.042 hours

The time taken by ‘B’ is greater than the time taken by ‘A’, therefore, ‘B’ will reach the meeting point before ‘A’.

The time taken by ‘B’ is 0.042 hours, which is equivalent to 52 minutes.

To find the time at which ‘B’ will reach the meeting point, we need to add 52 minutes to the time at which ‘B’ leaves Mumbai Central.

2 pm + 52 minutes = 3 pm

The time at which ‘B’ will reach the meeting point is 3 pm.

Instruction: The ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which will fit inside the cube is? options: A)2: π, B)7:2, C)8:2, D)6: π, E)8:3
Output: 

The volume of a cube is given by the formula V = s^3, where V is the volume of the cube, s is the length of one side of the cube.

If the volume of the cube is V, then the volume of the sphere which will fit inside the cube is given by the formula V = (4/3)πr^3, where V is the volume of the sphere, r is the radius of the sphere, and π is the constant for the volume of a sphere.

Therefore, we can write the equation as:

(4/3)πr^3 = 180

Output: 

The ratio of the area of a rectangle to its perimeter is constant. So, the area of the rectangular plot is directly proportional to the perimeter of the plot. Therefore, we can find the area of the plot by using the formula:

Area = Perimeter × Height

Since the height of the plot is not given, we cannot find the area of the plot.

Therefore, the answer is D) Cannot be determined.

The answer is: D) Cannot be determined.

The total number of red sweets in the bag is unknown. The only information we have is the ratio of red sweets to green sweets and the number of green sweets. We need to find the number of red sweets before we can write the answer.

Instruction: Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as do two rolls. Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes do. Two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as how many pita breads? options: A)12/25, B)3/2, C)3, D)2, E)25/3
Output: 

The given information is that six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two rolls, three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes, and two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as three pita breads.

Therefore, the common factor is the number of pita breads. So, the total amount of falafel in all the pita breads is equal to the total amount of falafel in all the rolls and baguettes.

Since three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes, it means that three rolls contain three-fifths of the total amount of falafel in all the rolls and baguettes.

Therefore, the total amount of falafel in all the rolls and baguettes is equal to six pita breads * (3/5) = 3.6 times the total amount of falafel in one pita bread.

The total amount of falafel in one pita bread is equal to 12/25 of the total amount of falafel in all the pita breads.

So, the total amount of falafel in all the pita breads is equal to 12/25 * 6 = 2.4 times the total amount of falafel in one pita bread.

Output: 
The formula for the area of a trapezium is given by:
A = (b + b)h/2
where A is the area, b is the base, h is the height, and the base and height are the dimensions of the trapezium.
Substituting the values into the formula, we get:
640 = (6 + 10)h/2
Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:
1120 = 6h + 10h
Subtracting 6h from both sides, we get:
10h = 1040
h = 40
The depth of the canal is 40 meters.

The answer is: A)26

**Note:** The answer is A)26 because the area of the trapezium is given by the formula A = (b + b)h/2, where A is the area, b is the base, h is the height, and the base and height are the dimensions of the trapezium. Therefore, to find the depth of the canal, we need to first find the height of the trapezium using the formula h = 640/10 = 64 meters.

S = 1500

We know that S = 500 + 5% * x, so we can substitute this into the second equation as:

1500 = 500 + 5% * x

To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation:

5% * x = 1500 - 500 = 1000

x = 1000 / 5% = $20000

Output: 
The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + b), where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and b is the breadth.

Substituting the values of l and b into the formula, we get
P = 2(4b + b) = 2(5b) = 10b

Since the length is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth, we can write
l = 4b + 1

Substituting this value of l into the formula for perimeter, we get
P = 10(4b + 1) = 40b + 10

Therefore, the minimum selling price per unit that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 is B

Instruction: If 27 bottles of soda cost A cents, how much will B bottles cost in dollars? options: A)AB/2700, B)27/AB, C)AB/270, D)2700/AB, E)100AB/27
Output: 

The cost of a bottle of soda is A cents, which is equivalent to 0.01 dollars.

If there are B bottles, the total cost of the bottles will be B times the cost of a bottle, which is 0.01B dollars.

To convert this to cents, we need to multiply by 100. This gives us B cents.

Therefore, the total cost of B bottles in cents is 0.01B cents.

To convert this to dollars, we need to divide by 100. This gives us B dollars.

Therefore, the total cost of B bottles in dollars is B dollars.

The answer is: B)27/AB

The total length of the fence is 13x/2 inches and the length of space between the pickets is 6 inches. So, the total number of length of pickets is 13x/2 - 6. The total length of the fence in feet is (13x/2 - 6) inches divided by 12, which is (13x/2 - 6)/12 feet.

The answer is: E)100AB/27

The total cost of B bottles in cents is 0.01B cents and the total length of the fence in feet is (13x/2 - 6) inches divided by 12, which is (13x/2 - 6) feet. So, the total cost of B bottles in cents is 0.01B","Instruction: A straight picket fence is composed of x pickets each of which is 1/2 inch wide.

Instruction: A jeep travels a certain distance taking 6 hours in the forward journey. During the return journey, it increased its speed by 12km/hr and took 4 hours. What is the distance travelled by the jeep? options: A)126km, B)144km, C)127km, D)228km, E)128km
Output: 

The relative speed of the jeep is increased by 12km/hr, therefore the time taken for the return journey will be reduced by 6 hours.

The distance travelled by the jeep in the forward journey is given by the formula: Distance = Speed x Time.

Substituting the values of speed and time into this formula, we get:

Distance travelled in forward journey = 55 x 6 = 330 miles

Therefore, the total distance travelled by the jeep is 330 miles.

The distance travelled by the jeep in return journey is given by the formula: Distance = Speed x Time.

Substituting the values of speed and time into this formula, we get:

Distance travelled in return journey = 52 x 4 = 208 miles

Therefore, the total distance travelled by the jeep is 330 + 208 = 558 miles.

The distance travelled by the jeep is 558 miles.

The answer is: B

The answer is: 5 hours.

Answer:A Answer: A

Instruction: If 120 is reduced to 96, what is the reduction percent? options: A)30%, B)40%, C)20%, D)10%, E)5%
Output: 

The original value (x1) is 14 and the new value (x2) is 96. So, we can write the equation as:

14/96 = x1/x2

Cross-multiplying, we get:

14x2 = 96x1

14x2 = 96x1

x = (96x1)/14

x = 8

The height of the tree (x2) is 8 metres. The height of the tree cast a shadow of 15 metres is 8 metres. So, the reduction percent is:

(8/8) x 100% = 100%
