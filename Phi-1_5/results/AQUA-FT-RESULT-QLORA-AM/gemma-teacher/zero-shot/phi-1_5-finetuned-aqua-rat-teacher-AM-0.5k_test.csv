Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year? options: A)20%, B)40%, C)50%, D)65%, E)75%
Output: 

The population of Boomtown is expected to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago.

To find the percent population increase, we need to calculate the difference between the population two years from now and the population one year ago, and then divide that by the population one year ago.

The population one year ago is 100,000.

The population two years from now is 100,000 x 2 = 200,000.

The percent population increase is (200,000 - 100,000) / 100,000 x 100% = 50%.

The answer is: B) 24

Explanation:

To find the number of sales of $250 each that the sales person must make in order to reach a salary of at least $1000, we need to calculate the total commission he will earn from each sale and then divide the salary by the commission.

The total commission he will earn from each sale is 10% of $250, which is 0.1 x $250 = $25.

The number of sales of $250 each that he must make is the salary divided by the commission, which is $1000 / $25 = 40.

Therefore, the answer is B) 24.

Output: 

The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost.

If the appliance was sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?

The answer is: B) 28%

Explanation:

The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. This means that the retail price was 60 percent of the wholesale cost.

If the appliance was sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then the retail price was 20 percent less than the original retail price. This means that the retail price was 80 percent of the original retail price.

The difference between the retail price and the wholesale cost is the percentage increase or decrease. To find the percentage increase or decrease, we can use the formula:

Percentage increase or decrease = (Retail price - Wholesale cost) / Wholesale cost * 100

Substituting the values, we get:

Percentage increase or decrease = (80 - 60) / 60 * 100

Percentage increase or decrease = 20 / 60 * 100

For what price did the retailer sell the appliance? options: A)$27.30, B)$51.00, C)$63.00, D)$70.00, E)$91.00
Output: 

The retailer sold the appliance for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00.

To find the selling price, we need to add the gross profit to the cost.

Gross profit = 40% of cost

Gross profit = 40% of cost = 0.4 * cost

Selling price = cost + gross profit

Selling price = cost + 0.4 * cost = 1.4 * cost

The selling price is $1.4 times the cost.

The answer is: B) $51.00

Explanation: The retailer sold the appliance for $51.00, which is 40 percent above the cost.

The cost of the appliance is the selling price divided by 1.4.

The cost of the appliance is $51.00 / 1.4 = $35.71

5. The monthly salary S of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales.

The answer is: B) $40000

Explanation:

To find the monthly sales, we need to use the formula:

S = 500 + 0.05S

where S is the monthly sales and S is the monthly salary.

We want to find the value of S that makes S = $1500.

Substitute S = $1500 into the formula:

of 55. If the overall class average was 76, what percent of the class passed? options: A)44%, B)66%, C)68%, D)72%, E)75%
Output: 

The passing students had an average of 83, while the failing students had an average of 55. The overall class average was 76.

To find the percentage of the class that passed, we need to find the total number of students who passed and divide it by the total number of students in the class.

The total number of students who passed is the sum of the passing students and the failing students.

Total number of students who passed = 83 + 55 = 128

The total number of students in the class is the sum of the passing students and the failing students.

Total number of students in the class = 128 + 55 = 183

The percentage of the class that passed is the total number of students who passed divided by the total number of students in the class, multiplied by 100.

Percentage of the class that passed = (128/183) x 100 = 74.7%
