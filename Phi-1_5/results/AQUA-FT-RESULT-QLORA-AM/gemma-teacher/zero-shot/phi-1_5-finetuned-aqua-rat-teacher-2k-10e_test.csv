If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum? options: A)36 grams, B)40 grams, C)42 grams, D)48 grams, E)50 grams
Output: 

The weight of a coin is directly proportional to its volume and the density of the alloy. The density of aluminum is 2 g/cm3 and the density of silver is 4 g/cm3. Therefore, the volume of aluminum in the alloy will be half of the volume of silver.

The volume of the coin is 3/2 x 15 mm x 15 mm = 56.25 cm3. The weight of the alloy is 30 grams. The volume of pure aluminum in the alloy is 56.25 cm3 x 2 g/cm3 = 14 grams.

Output: 

**Explanation:**

The ship traveled 180 miles. So, the speed of the ship is 180/x miles per hour.

The plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship, which is 10x miles per hour.

When they meet, the distance traveled by the ship and plane is equal to the distance traveled by the ship, which is 180 miles.

Therefore, we can write the equation as:

x = 180/10

x = 18 miles per hour

The distance traveled by the plane is 18x miles per hour.

The distance traveled by the ship and plane is 180 miles.

So, the time taken by the ship and plane to meet is 180/18 = 10 hours.

The distance traveled by the ship and plane is 18x * 10 = 238 miles.

**The answer is:** A) 238

Output: 

Ram and Krishna start from A and B, respectively, at the same time and travel towards each other at constant speeds of 20m/s and 40m/s, respectively, along the same route.

The distance traveled by Ram is given by the formula:

Distance traveled = Speed x Time

Substituting the values of speed and time into this formula, we get:

Distance traveled by Ram = 20 x 10 = 200 meters

The distance traveled by Krishna is given by the formula:

Distance traveled = Speed x Time

Substituting the values of speed and time into this formula, we get:

Distance traveled by Krishna = 40 x 10 = 400 meters

The total distance traveled by Ram and Krishna is the sum of the distance traveled by each of them:

Total distance traveled = 200 + 400 = 600 meters

Therefore, the total distance between A to B is 600 meters.

Train ‘B’ leaves Mumbai Central for Lucknow by the same route at 2 pm on the same day, running at the speed of 72 kmph. At what time will the two trains meet each other? options: A)12 am on the next day, B)5 am on the next day, C)5 pm on the next day, D)2 pm on the next day, E)None of these
Output: 

**Explanation:**

The time taken by train 'A' to reach Lucknow is 40 kmph and the time taken by train 'B' to reach Lucknow is 72 kmph. Therefore, the relative speed of the two trains is 40 + 72 = 112 kmph.

The distance between Mumbai Central and Lucknow is equal to the time taken by train 'A' to reach Lucknow multiplied by the speed of train 'A'. So, the distance is 112 kmph * 11 am = 1220 km.

The time taken by train 'B' to cover the distance is equal to the distance divided by the speed of train 'B'. So, the time taken is 1220 km / 72 kmph = 16.66 hours.

The time taken by train 'B' to reach Lucknow is 16.66 hours.

The time taken by train 'B' to reach Lucknow is 2 pm.

**The answer is:** B) 5 am on the next day.

Output: 

**Step 1:** Calculate the area of the rectangular plot.

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = l*w, where A is the area, l is the length, and w is the width.

**Step 2:** Find the length and width of the plot.

Since the perimeter is 340 metres, we know that the length and width of the plot are equal. Therefore, we can write:

2l + 2w = 340

**Step 3:** Substitute the area formula into the perimeter formula.

We know that the area is equal to the length times the width, so we can write:

2l + 2w = l*w

**Step 4:** Solve for l and w.

We can solve this equation for l and w as follows:

l = 340/2w

w = 340/l

**The answer is:**

A) 3400

The cost of gardening 1-metre – broad boundary around a rectangular plot having perimeter of 340 metres at the rate of 10 per square metre is $3400.

n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16 = 0

Squaring both sides, we get

n2 + 2√n(n + 4) = 0

Squaring both sides, we get

n2 + 4n + 16 = 0

Solving for n, we get

n = 4 or n = -4

Since n must be a whole number, we can see that the only value of n that satisfies the inequality is 4.

**Answer:** A)20 < x < 54

**The answer is:**

Output: 

**Explanation:**

The distance traveled by a point on the edge of a fan blade that is rotating in a plane is given by the formula:

$$d = 10 \times v$$

where d is the distance traveled, v is the velocity of the fan blade, and 10 is the number of revolutions per minute.

To find the velocity of the fan blade, we need to convert 300 revolutions per minute to centimeters per second. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so the velocity of the fan blade is 300/60 = 5 revolutions per second.

Now we can substitute this value of v into the formula for distance traveled:

$$d = 10 \times 5 = 50$$

Therefore, the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade after 30 seconds is 50 centimeters.

**The answer is:** E)7500pi

**Note:** The answer is E)7500pi because the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade is 7500pi centimeters.

Output: 

The area of a trapezium is given by the formula A = (b1 + b2)h/2, where A is the area, b1 and b2 are the bases, and h is the height.

Given information:
- The area of the cross-section is 640 square meters.
- The canal is 10 m wide at the top and 6 m wide at the bottom.

We know that the area of a trapezium is equal to the product of its bases and height. So, we can substitute the values of b1, b2, and h into the formula to get:

A = (10 + 6)h/2

Since the area is equal to 640 square meters, we can rearrange the formula to get:

h = 2(10 + 6)h/2

h = 20(6h + 10)

h = 120h + 600

h = 120(h/120)

h = 6h

h = 6(6h/6)

h = 6h

Therefore, the depth of the canal is 6h.

Question 10: A company has a profit margin of 20%. If the company's revenue is $500,000, what is the company's profit?

Solution:
The profit margin is 20%, which means that the company's profit is 20% of its revenue. To find the company's profit, we need to multiply its revenue by its profit margin:

Profit = $500,000 x 0.20 = $100,000

Therefore, the company's profit is $100,000.
