How many letters need to be distinct? options: A)74453, B)64543, C)74325, D)65000, E)97656
Output: 

**Explanation:**

To form a distinct bike no. using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s, we need to choose 2 letters from the set of 26 letters and 2 no.'s from the set of 26 no.'s.

The number of distinct bike no.s that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s is given by the formula:

$$n(n+1)(n+2) = n(n+1)(n+2)$$

where n is the number of letters and (n+1)(n+2) is the number of distinct bike no.s that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s.

Substituting the values of n and (n+1)(n+2) into the formula, we get:

$$n(n+1)(n+2) = n(n+1)(n+2) = n(n+1)(n+2) = n(n+1)(n+2) = n(n+1)(n+2) = n(n+1)(n+2) = n(n+1"

Output: 
**Explanation:**
The simple interest formula is given by the formula:

I = P * r * t

where I is the simple interest, P is the principal amount, r is the rate of interest per annum, and t is the time period in years.

Given that the simple interest is Rs. 300, the principal amount is Rs. 5000, and the time period is 3 years, we can substitute these values into the formula to get:

300 = 5000 * r * 3

Solving for r, we get:

r = 300 / (5000 * 3) = 0.02

After how many hours will they be able to buy the cake together? options: A)1 hour, B)2 hours, C)3 hours, D)4 hours, E)5 hours
Output: 

**Explanation:**

Sharon and Karen work together to earn enough tips to buy an ice cream cake. Sharon works for 5 hours and Karen works for 4 hours. Therefore, the total number of hours they work together is 5 + 4 = 9 hours.

To buy the cake, they need to earn enough tips to cover the cost of the cake. The cost of the cake is $10. Therefore, the number of tips they need to earn is $10.

The number of tips they need to earn is equal to the cost of the cake divided by the number of hours they work together. Therefore, the number of tips they need to earn is $10 / 9 = $1.11.

The number of hours they need to work together to earn enough tips to buy the cake is equal to the number of tips they need to earn divided by the number of hours they work together. Therefore, the number of hours they need to work together is $1.11 / $1.11 = 1 hour.

What should the monthly sales be so that her monthly salary reaches $1500? options: A)$50000, B)$40000, C)$30000, D)$20000, E)None of these
Output: 
1. S = 500 + 0.05S
2. 1500 = 500 + 0.05S
3. S = 1500 - 500
4. S = 1000
5. S = $50000

The answer is:

The answer is: B) $40000

Explanation:

The monthly salary S is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. To find the monthly sales, we need to solve the equation S = 500 + 0.05S for S.

S = 500 + 0.05S

S = 500 + 0.05(S - 500)

S = 500 + 0.05(S - 500)

S = 500 + 0.05(S - 500)

S = 500 + 0.05(S - 500)

S = 500 + 0.05(S - 500)

S = 500 + 0.05(S - 500)

S = 500 + 0.05(S - 500)

S = 500 + 0.05(S - 500)

S = 500 + 0.05(S - 500)"

The area of a trapezium is given by the formula A = (b1 + b2)h/2, where A is the area, b1 and b2 are the bases, and h is the height.

Given that the area of cross-section is 640 square meters, and the width of the canal is 10 m, we can substitute these values into the formula to get the equation:

640 = (10 + 6)h/2

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

The height of the room is: options: A)2.6m, B)3.9m, C)4m, D)4.2m, E)4.4m
Output: 
**Explanation:**

The height of the room is the ratio of the height to the semi-perimeter. So, the height of the room is 2/5 = 0.4m.

The area of the room is the product of the height and the width of the room. So, the area of the room is 0.4m x 50cm = 20 sq.m.

The area of the doors and windows is the product of the area of the room and the area of the doors and windows. So, the area of the doors and windows is 20 sq.m x 15 = 300 sq.m.

The cost of paper is the product of the area of the walls and the cost per meter of paper. So, the cost of paper is 20 sq.m x Rs.2 per meter = Rs.40.

The cost of paper is less than the cost of paper for the walls of the room. So, the cost of paper is Rs.40.

The answer is: B) 3.9m.

The height of the room is 3.9m.
