After how many hours will they be able to buy the cake together? options: A)1 hour, B)2 hours, C)3 hours, D)4 hours, E)5 hours
Output: 

**Explanation:**

Sharon and Karen work together to earn enough tips to buy an ice cream cake. Sharon works for 5 hours and Karen works for 4 hours. Therefore, the total number of hours they work together is 5 + 4 = 9 hours.

To buy the cake, they need to earn enough tips to cover the cost of the cake. The cost of the cake is $20. Therefore, the number of tips they need to earn is $20.

The number of tips they need to earn is equal to the cost of the cake divided by the number of hours they work together. Therefore, the number of tips they need to earn is $20 / 9 = $2.22.

The number of hours they need to work together to earn enough tips to buy the cake is equal to the number of tips they need to earn divided by the number of hours they work together. Therefore, the number of hours they need to work together is $2.22 / $2.22 = 1 hour.

Output: 
**Explanation:**

The monthly salary S is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales.

To find the monthly sales, we need to solve the equation:

S = 500 + 0.05S

S = 1500

Subtracting 500 from both sides, we get:

0.05S = 1000

S = $20,000

Output: 
**Explanation:**

The sum of the ages of all the members is 250. The youngest member is just 7 years old. So, the sum of the ages of all the members is 250 - 7 = 243.

The common difference is 3 months. So, the age of the youngest member is 7 + 3 = 10 years.

The age of the next member is 10 + 3 = 13 years.

The age of the next member is 13 + 3 = 16 years.

The age of the next member is 16 + 3 = 19 years.

The age of the next member is 19 + 3 = 22 years.

The age of the next member is 22 + 3 = 25 years.

The age of the next member is 25 + 3 = 28 years.

The age of the next member is 28 + 3 = 31 years.

The age of the next member is 31 + 3 = 34 years.

The age of the next member is 34 + 3 = 37 years.

The age of the next member is 37 + 3 = 40 years.

The age of the next member is 40 + 3 = 43 years.

Output: 
1. English: 5
2. Hindi: 6
3. Mathematics: 7
4. History: 8
5. Geography: 9
6. Science: 10

**Explanation:**

To arrange the books on the shelf, you need to arrange them in a specific order. The order is English, Hindi, Mathematics, History, Geography, and Science.

The number of ways to arrange the books is given by the formula:

n! / (n-r)!

where n is the total number of books and r is the number of books to be arranged.

For English, there are 5 books to arrange, so the number of ways to arrange them is:

5! / (5-5)! = 5! / 0! = 5

For Hindi, there are 6 books to arrange, so the number of ways to arrange them is:

6! / (6-6)! = 6! / 0! = 6

For Mathematics, there are 7 books to arrange, so the number of ways to arrange them is:

7! / (7-7)! = 7! / 0! = 7

2. Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes do.
3. Two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as how many pita breads?

The answer is: B) 3/2

Explanation:

To find the amount of falafel in each pita bread, we need to divide the total amount of falafel in six pita breads by the number of pita breads.

Total amount of falafel in six pita breads = 6 pita breads * x amount of falafel per pita bread

x = 6 pita breads * y amount of falafel per pita bread

Therefore, the amount of falafel in each pita bread is y.

To find the amount of falafel in each roll, we need to divide the total amount of falafel in three rolls by the number of rolls.

Total amount of falafel in three rolls = 3 rolls * x amount of falafel per roll"

It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. The height of the room is: options: A)2.6m, B)3.9m, C)4m, D)4.2m, E)4.4m
Output: 
**Explanation:**

The height of the room is the ratio of the height to the semi-perimeter. Therefore, the height of the room is 2:5 = 2/5 = 0.4m.

The area of the room is the product of the height and the width. Therefore, the area of the room is 0.4m x 50cm = 20 sq.m.

The area of the doors and windows is the product of the area of the room and the area of the doors and windows. Therefore, the area of the doors and windows is 20 sq.m x 15 sq.m = 300 sq.m.

The cost of paper is Rs.2 per meter. Therefore, the cost of paper for the walls of the room is 300 sq.m x Rs.2 per meter = Rs.600.

The cost of paper for the doors and windows is Rs.50 per meter. Therefore, the cost of paper for the doors and windows is 300 sq.m x Rs.50 per meter = Rs.15000.

The total cost of paper is Rs.600 + Rs.15000 = Rs.16000.
