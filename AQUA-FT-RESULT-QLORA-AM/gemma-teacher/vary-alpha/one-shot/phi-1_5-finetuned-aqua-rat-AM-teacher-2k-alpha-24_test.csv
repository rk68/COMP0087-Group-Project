Instruction: You can purchase one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents, or two sodas and three energy bars for 300
cents. If the costs of the items do not change, compute the cost in cents of six sodas and seven bars. options: A)500, B)600, C)750, D)800, E)900
Output: 

The cost of one soda is 150 cents, and the cost of one energy bar is 150 cents. Therefore, the cost of six sodas is 6 x 150 cents = 900 cents.

The cost of two sodas is 2 x 150 cents = 300 cents.

The cost of three energy bars is 3 x 150 cents = 450 cents.

The total cost of six sodas and seven bars is 900 cents + 300 cents + 450 cents = 1500 cents.

Therefore, the cost of six sodas and seven bars is 1500 cents.

Output: 

The formula to find the number of distinct bike no's is given by the formula:

n(n+1) = n(n-1) + 1

where n is the number of letters and n(n+1) is the number of distinct bike no's.

Substituting the values of n and n(n+1) into the formula, we get:

n(n+1) = n(n-1) + 1

n(n+1) = n(n-1) + 1

n(n+1) = n(n-1) + 1

n(n+1) = n(n-1) + 1

n(n+1) = n(n-1) + 1

n(n+1) = n(n-1) + 1

n(n+1) = n(n-1) + 1

n(n+1) = n(n-1) + 1

n(n+1) = n(n-1) + 1

Output: 

The area of a square is given by the formula A = s^2, where s is the length of one side.

The area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr^2, where r is the radius of the circle.

The area of a semi circle is given by the formula A = (1/2)πr^2, where r is the radius of the semi circle.

Since the two semi circles are cut down, the area of the remaining paper will be the area of the square minus the area of the two semi circles.

The area of the square is given by the formula A = s^2, where s is the length of one side.

The area of the two semi circles is given by the formula A = πr^2, where r is the radius of the semi circle.

Therefore, the area of the remaining paper will be A = s^2 - 2πr^2.

The area of the remaining paper is 8.75 cm^2.

The area of the rectangle is given by the formula A = l x w, where A is the area, l is the length, and w is the width.

Substituting the values of l and w into the formula, we get A = 27 x 17 = 495 cm^2.

The area of the square is given by the formula A = s^2, where A is the area and s is the side length.

Substituting the value of A into the formula, we get 495 = s^2.

Output: 

The question is asking for the distance Bill can travel on a windy day in 21 minutes. Bill's speed is reduced by 4 mph on a windy day, so his speed is 15 - 4 = 11 mph.

To find the distance Bill can travel in 21 minutes, we need to find the distance he can travel in 1 minute. To do this, we divide the distance he can travel in 1 minute by the number of minutes in 21 minutes.

11 miles/minute = 0.11 miles/minute

Now we can multiply the distance he can travel in 1 minute by the number of minutes in 21 minutes to find the distance he can travel in 21 minutes.

0.11 miles/minute x 21 minutes = 2.65 miles

Instruction: Suppose you can travel from a place M to a place N by 3 buses, from place N to place O by 4 buses, from place O to place P by 1 buses and from place P to place Q by 3 buses. In how many ways can you travel from M to Q ? options: A)24, B)36, C)72, D)84, E)None
Output: 

The total number of ways to travel from M to Q is given by the formula:

n(n-1) / 2

where n is the number of steps from M to Q.

For the first part of the journey, the number of steps is 20. So, the number of ways to travel from M to Q is:

20(20-1) / 2 = 20(19) / 2 = 380

For the second part of the journey, the number of steps is 10. So, the number of ways to travel from N to Q is:

10(10-1) / 2 = 10(9) / 2 = 90

The total number of ways to travel from M to Q is:

380 + 90 = 440

Therefore, the speed of the elevator is:

440 / 10 = 44 steps/minute

The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?

The answer is B) 1500p.

The reason for this is that the number of phones shipped is directly proportional to the number of pallets and the number of phones per pallet. Therefore, if the number of phones shipped is increased, the number of pallets and the number of phones per pallet will also increase.

The number of phones shipped is 4 crates, which means that 4 x 1250 = 5000 phones are shipped. The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost, which means that the original retail price of an appliance was 5000 + 6000 = 11000 phones.

Output: 

**Explanation:**

Given information:
n = 36, x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4)

We know that the number of students who took physics is 20% of the total number of students, which is 20% of 36 = 0.2 * 36 = 7.2.

Similarly, the number of students who took math is 28% of the total number of students, which is 28% of 36 = 0.28 * 36 = 8.4.

Therefore, the number of students who took physics and math is 7.2 + 8.4 = 15.6.

The least possible number of students in the school is the number of students who took physics and math, which is 15.6.

**The answer is:** D) 28

The answer is 28 because the number of students who took physics and math is the same as the number of students who took physics and math, which is 15.6.

Output: 

The minimum daily requirement of vitamin E is 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. Therefore, to obtain at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, a person must eat a minimum of 8.5 grams of the health food.

The cost of the health food is $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week. Therefore, the cost of the health food for the rest of the days of the week is $1 per day.

The total cost of the health food for the rest of the days of the week is $1 per day x 7 days = $7 per week.

The total cost of the health food for the week is $7 per week x 2 = $14 per week.

The total cost of the health food for the week is $14 per week x 8.5 grams = $116.5.

The cost of the health food for the week is $116.5.

Output: 

The simple interest is given by the formula I = P*r*t, where I is the simple interest, P is the principal, r is the rate of interest, and t is the time period.

Substituting the values into the formula, we get I = 5000*0.12*2 = Rs. 1200.

The C.I. is given by the formula C.I. = P*r*t, where C.I. is the C.I. at the same rate for Rs. 5000 for 2 years in Rs.72.

Substituting the values into the formula, we get C.I. = 5000*0.12*2 = Rs. 1200.

Output: 

The monthly salary S of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. To find the monthly sales, we need to solve the equation:

S = 500 + 0.05S

where S is the monthly salary and 0.05S is the monthly sales.

We want to find the value of S that makes S = $1500, so we need to find the value of S that satisfies the equation:

1500 = 500 + 0.05S

S = $3000

Therefore, the monthly sales should be $3000.

Instruction: The ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which will fit inside the cube is? options: A)2: π, B)7:2, C)8:2, D)6: π, E)8:3
Output: 

The volume of a cube is given by the formula V = s^3, where s is the length of the side of the cube. The volume of a sphere is given by the formula V = (4/3)πr^3, where r is the radius of the sphere.

If the volume of the cube is V, then the volume of the sphere is (4/3)πr^3.

Given that V = 70, we can find the value of r as follows:

70 = (4/3)πr^3
r^3 = 70/4π
r = ∛(70/4π)

The distance between A and B is given by the formula d = r*s, where d is the distance, r is the radius of the sphere, and s is the length of the side of the cube.

Substituting the value of r into the formula, we get:

d = ∛(70/4π) * 70

d = 70

Therefore, the distance between A and B is 70 miles.

The answer is: A) 180

Output: 

The distance traveled by a point on the edge of a fan blade that is rotating in a plane is given by the formula:

Distance traveled = (2πr) * (r/10) * 30

where r is the distance traveled by the point from the center of the fan.

Substituting the value of r into the formula, we get:

Distance traveled = (2π(10) * (10/10) * 30) = 750pi

Therefore, the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade that is rotating in a plane is 750pi centimeters.

Output: 

The height of the room is 2:5, which means that the height is 2/5 of the total height of the room. Therefore, the height of the room is 2/5 * 2 = 0.4m.

The area of the room is 15 sq.m, which means that the width of the room is 15/2 = 7.5m.

The cost of paper is Rs.2 per meter, which means that the cost of paper for the walls is 2 * 7.5 = Rs.15.

The cost of doors and windows is Rs.2 per square meter, which means that the cost of doors and windows is 2 * 15 = Rs.30.

Therefore, the total cost of paper for the walls is Rs.15 + Rs.30 = Rs.45.

The total cost of paper for the walls is Rs.45, which is equal to the cost of paper for the walls.

The time it takes to paper the walls of the room is 10 minutes, which is equal to the time it takes to paper the walls of the room.

Output: 

The monthly salary S of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales.

To find the new expenditure, we need to first calculate the new monthly sales.

If the income increases by 20%, then the new monthly sales will be 70% of the new income.

The new monthly sales will be 0.7S.

The new monthly salary will be $500 + 0.05S.

To reach $1500, the new monthly salary must be $1500.

Therefore, S = $1500.

Output: 

The length of the rectangular piece is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth. So, the length is 4 times the breadth plus 1m.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:

Perimeter = 2(length + breadth)

Substituting the values of length and breadth into the formula, we get:

Perimeter = 2(4(4m) + 1m)

Perimeter = 2(16m + 1m)

Perimeter = 2(17m)

Perimeter = 34m

Output: 

The given information is:

M = abc
N = cba
M - N + 396c = 990

We know that M > N and M - N + 396c = 990. So, we can find the values of M that are more than 300 by substituting the values of M and N into the equation.

If M = abc, then the value of N is cba.

If M > N, then the value of M is greater than N.

If M - N + 396c = 990, then the value of M - N is greater than 990.

Therefore, the values of M that are more than 300 are:
