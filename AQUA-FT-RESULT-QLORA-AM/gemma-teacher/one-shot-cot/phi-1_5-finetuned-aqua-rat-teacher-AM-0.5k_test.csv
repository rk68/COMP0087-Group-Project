3. Find the number of files that are infected by a worm only.
4. Find the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm.
5. Find the number of files that are NOT infected by a virus.

1. The number of files that are infected by a virus and a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. Therefore, the number of files that are infected by a virus and a worm is 2.5 * 2.5 = 6.25.
2. The number of files that are infected by a virus only is 50% of the total number of files. Therefore, the number of files that are infected by a virus only is 50% * 250 = 125.
3. The number of files that are infected by a worm only is the number of files that are infected by a virus only minus the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. Therefore, the number of files that are infected by a worm only is 125 - 6.25 = 118.75.

Output: 

1. Calculate the commission on each sale: 10% of $250 = $25
2. Calculate the total commission on 15 sales: $25 * 15 = $375
3. Calculate the total salary: $1000
4. Calculate the number of sales needed: $1000 / $375 = 3.33
5. Round up to the nearest whole number: 4 sales

The answer is: E

Explanation: The sales person needs to make at least $1000 in salary. He gets a 10% commission on each sale he makes. So, he needs to make at least $1000 / $25 = 40 sales. If he makes 40 sales, he will earn a total commission of $25 * 40 = $1000. Therefore, he will reach his salary of at least $1000.

The answer is: E

Explanation: The sales person needs to make at least $1000 in salary. He gets a 10% commission on each sale he makes. So, he needs to make at least $1000 / $25 = 40 sales. If he makes 40 sales, he will earn a total commission of $25 * 40 = $1000. Therefore, he will reach his salary of at least $1000.

Instruction: The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost? options: A)20%, B)28%, C)36%, D)40%, E)42%
Output: 

If the original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost, then the wholesale cost was 60 percent less than the retail price.

Retail price = 60% of wholesale cost

Retail price = 60% of wholesale cost - 60% of wholesale cost

Retail price = 60% of wholesale cost - 60% of wholesale cost

Retail price = 60% of wholesale cost

If the appliance was sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then the retail price was 20 percent less than the original retail price.

Retail price = 20% of original retail price

Retail price = 20% of original retail price - 20% of original retail price

Retail price = 20% of original retail price

Retail price = 60% of wholesale cost

The answer is: D) 40%

Explanation: The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost? The answer is 40%.

The reason is that the retail price is 60 percent of the wholesale cost, and the retail price is 20 percent less than the original retail price. Therefore, the retail price is 60 percent of the wholesale cost minus 20 percent of the original retail price.

Output: 

The total number of coins that she brought is the sum of the number of copper coins and brass coins.

Number of copper coins = 20 cents
Number of brass coins = 25 cents

Total number of coins = 20 + 25 = 45

Total amount of money = $3.40

The value of each coin is 20 cents and 25 cents respectively.

Total value of coins = 20 x 45 = 900 cents

Total value of coins = $3.40 = 3.40 dollars

The minimum number of copper coins that she brought is:

Number of copper coins = Total number of coins / Value of each coin
Number of copper coins = 45 / 20 = 2.25

Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins that she brought is 2.

Output: 

The formula for simple interest is given by: I = P * r * t

Where:
I = Interest
P = Principal
r = Rate of interest
t = Time

Given:
I = 300
P = 5000
r =?
t = 3

Substituting the values in the formula, we get:
300 = 5000 * r * 3

Solving for r, we get:
r = 300 / (5000 * 3)
r = 0.06

Therefore, the rate of interest per annum is 6%.

The answer is: C

**Explanation:**

The formula for simple interest is given by: I = P * r * t

Where:
I = Interest

Substituting the values in the formula, we get:
300 = 5000 * r * 3

Solving for r, we get:
r = 300 / (5000 * 3)
r = 0.06

Output: 

The ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, which means that for every 4 boys, there are 3 girls.

If the group has a total of 64 boys and 40 girls, then the total number of members is:

64 + 40 = 104

The ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, which means that for every 4 boys, there are 3 girls.

Therefore, the number of boys in the group is:

4/7 x 104 = 51.71

Since the number of boys must be a whole number, the number of boys in the group is 51.

The number of girls in the group is:

3/7 x 104 = 51

Output: 

The minimum selling price per component is $226.

The yearly profit is given by:

Yearly profit = (selling price per component - production cost per component) x number of components produced

Yearly profit = (selling price per component - production cost per component) x 420

Yearly profit = 420 x (selling price per component - production cost per component)

Yearly profit = 420 x (selling price per component - production cost per component) - 420 x production cost per component

Yearly profit = 420 x (selling price per component - production cost per component) - 420 x production cost per component

Yearly profit = 420 x (selling price per component - production cost per component) - 420 x production cost per component

Yearly profit = 420 x (selling price per component - production cost per component) - 420 x production cost per component

Yearly profit = 420 x (selling price per component - production cost per component) - 420 x production cost per component

Yearly profit = 420 x (selling price per component - production cost per component) - 420 x production cost per component

Yearly profit = 420 x (selling price per component - production cost per component) - 420 x production cost per component

ANSWER:E Answer: E

Instruction: A retailer sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00. For what price did the retailer sell the appliance? options: A)$27.30, B)$51.00, C)$63.00, D)$70.00, E)$91.00
Output: 

40% of cost is (40/100) * cost = 0.4 * cost

The gross profit is the selling price minus the cost, which is $20.00.

So, the selling price is $20.00 + 0.4 * cost = $20.00 + 0.4 * cost

The selling price is $20.00 + 0.4 * cost = $20.00 + 0.4 * cost

The selling price is $20.00 + 0.4 * cost = $20.00 + 0.4 * cost

The selling price is $20.00 + 0.4 * cost = $20.00 + 0.4 * cost

The selling price is $20.00 + 0.4 * cost = $20.00 + 0.4 * cost

The selling price is $20.00 + 0.4 * cost = $20.00 + 0.4 * cost

The selling price is $20.00 + 0.4 * cost = $20.00 + 0.4 * cost

The selling price is $20.00 + 0.4 * cost = $20.00 + 0.4 * cost

The selling price is $20.00 + 0.4 * cost = $20.00 + 0.4 * cost

Instruction: there are more than 501 students in a school such that 20% of them exactly took physics and 28% of them exactly took math. What could be the least possible no of students in the school? options: A)550, B)570, C)600, D)700, E)none of these
Output: 

Explanation:

If 20% of the students took physics, then the remaining 80% must have taken math.

If 28% of the students took math, then the remaining 72% must have taken physics.

Therefore, the least possible number of students in the school is:

Total number of students = 501

Number of students who took physics = 20% of 501 = 102

Number of students who took math = 28% of 501 = 153

Number of students who took physics and math = 102 + 153 = 207

Number of students who took physics and math = (207 / 2) = 102

Therefore, the least possible number of students in the school is:

Total number of students = 501

Number of students who took physics = 102

Number of students who took math = 153

Number of students who took physics and math = 102

Number of students who took physics and math = (102 / 2) = 51

Therefore, the least possible number of students in the school is:

Total number of students = 501

Number of students who took physics = 102

Number of students who took math = 153

Number of students who took physics and math = 102

Number of students who took physics and math = (102 / 2) = 51

Therefore, the least possible number of students in the school is:

Instruction: A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point. options: A)238, B)289, C)200, D)287, E)187
Output: 

The speed of the plane is 10 times the speed of the ship. So, the distance traveled by the plane is 10 times the distance traveled by the ship.

The distance traveled by the ship is 180 miles.

The distance traveled by the plane is 10 times 180 miles = 1800 miles.

The total distance traveled by both the ship and the plane is 180 miles + 1800 miles = 2160 miles.

The distance between the starting point and the meeting point is 2160 miles.

Therefore, the distance when they meet is 2160 miles.

The answer is: B

**Note:** The answer is B because the distance traveled by the plane is 1800 miles, which is 10 times the distance traveled by the ship.

**Explanation:** The distance traveled by the plane is 10 times the distance traveled by the ship. So, the distance traveled by the plane is 10 times 180 miles = 1800 miles. The total distance traveled by both the ship and the plane is 180 miles + 1800 miles = 2160 miles. The distance between the starting point and the meeting point is 2160 miles. Therefore, the distance when they meet is 2160 miles.

Output: 

The difference between simple interest and C.I. at the same rate for Rs.5000 for 2 years in Rs.72 is Rs.72.

The rate of interest is 12%.

The answer is: E

Explanation:

The formula for simple interest is:

I = P * r * t

where I is the interest, P is the principal, r is the rate of interest, and t is the time period.

In this case, the principal is Rs.5000, the rate of interest is 12%, and the time period is 2 years.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

I = 5000 * 0.12 * 2

I = 1200

Therefore, the interest is Rs.1200.

The total amount to be paid back is Rs.5000 + Rs.1200 = Rs.6220.

The answer is: E

Explanation:

The answer is E because the interest is Rs.1200, which is less than the total amount to be paid back. Therefore, the answer is E.

Output: 

According to the given information, Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years back. So, Ajay's age 10 years ago was half of Sachin's age.

Ajay's age 10 years ago = 1/2 * Sachin's age 10 years ago
Ajay's age 10 years ago = 1/2 * 15 = 7.5

Ajay's age today = Ajay's age 10 years ago + 10
Ajay's age today = 7.5 + 10 = 17.5

Ajay's age today is 18 years old.

answer: B

Explanation: According to the given information, Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years back. So, Ajay's age 10 years ago was half of Sachin's age.

Ajay's age 10 years ago = 1/2 * Sachin's age 10 years ago
Ajay's age 10 years ago = 1/2 * 15 = 7.5

Ajay's age today = Ajay's age 10 years ago + 10
Ajay's age today = 7.5 + 10 = 17.5

Instruction: The monthly salary S of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. What should the monthly sales be so that her monthly salary reaches $1500? options: A)$50000, B)$40000, C)$30000, D)$20000, E)None of these
Output: 

The monthly salary of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales.

So, the monthly salary of a shop assistant is given by the formula:

S = 500 + 0.05S

where S is the monthly salary and S is the monthly sales.

We want to find the monthly sales so that the shop assistant's monthly salary reaches $1500.

1500 = 500 + 0.05S

1500 - 500 = 0.05S

1000 = 0.05S

S = $2000

Therefore, the monthly sales should be $2000.

Answer: E

Explanation: The monthly salary of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales.

So, the monthly salary of a shop assistant is given by the formula:

S = 500 + 0.05S

where S is the monthly salary and S is the monthly sales.

We want to find the monthly sales so that the shop assistant's monthly salary reaches $1500.

1500 = 500 + 0.05S

1500 - 500 = 0.05S

1000 = 0.05S

S = $2000

Therefore, the monthly sales should be $2000.

This is the answer.

Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y. options: A)144km, B)72 km, C)126km, D)84 km, E)48km
Output: 

Let x be the distance between X and Y.

Allen travels at 54 kmph and covers x km in 1 hour.

Bob travels at 78 kmph and covers x km in 1 hour.

The time taken by Allen to cover x km is x/54 hours.

The time taken by Bob to cover x km is x/78 hours.

The total time taken by Allen and Bob to cover x km is x/54 + x/78 = 1 hour.

Multiplying both sides by 54, we get:

x = 54x/54 + 54x/78 = 54x/54 + 54x/78 = 54x/54 + 54x/78 = 54x/54 + 54x/78 = 54x/54 + 54x/78 = 54x/54 + 54x/78 = 54x/54 + 54x/78 = 54x/54 + 54x/78 = 54x/54 + 54x/78 = 54x/54 + 54x/78 = 54x/54 + 54x/78 = 54x/54 + 54x/78 = 54x/54 + 54x/78 = 54x/54 + 54x/78 = 54x/54 + 54x/78 = 54x/54 + 54x/78 = 54x/54 + 54x/78 = 54x/54 + 54x/78","Instruction: Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr.

Instruction: The ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which will fit inside the cube is? options: A)2: π, B)7:2, C)8:2, D)6: π, E)8:3
Output: 

The ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which will fit inside the cube is:

V_cube/V_sphere = V_sphere/V_cube

The volume of a sphere is given by the formula:

V_sphere = (4/3)πr^3

The volume of a cube is given by the formula:

V_cube = s^3

where s is the length of one side of the cube.

The ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which will fit inside the cube is:

V_cube/V_sphere = V_sphere/V_cube

V_sphere = (4/3)πr^3

V_cube = s^3

Substituting the values of V_sphere and V_cube in the ratio formula, we get:

(4/3)πr^3/s^3 = V_sphere/V_cube

Therefore, the ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which will fit inside the cube is:

V_sphere/V_cube = (4/3)πr^3/s^3

Answer C Answer: C

Instruction: Joe's age, Joe's sister's age and Joe’s fathers age sums up to 100. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Find the age of Joe's father? options: A)45, B)48, C)50, D)55, E)58
Output: 

Let Joe's age be x, his sister's age be y and his father's age be z.

According to the question,

x + y + z = 100

When Joe is as old as his father,

x = z

When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father.

y = 2z

Substituting the value of x in the first equation, we get:

y + y + z = 100

2y + z = 100

y = 100 - z

Substituting the value of y in the second equation, we get:

z = 2(100 - z)

z = 200 - 2z

z = 200

Therefore, Joe's father is 200 years old.

Answer: C

**Explanation:**

The question states that Joe's age, his sister's age and his father's age sum up to 100. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father.

The area of a trapezium is given by the formula: A = (b1 + b2) * h / 2

Given:
b1 = 10 m
b2 = 6 m
h = 640 m

A = (10 + 6) * 640 / 2
A = 640

Therefore, the depth of the canal is:

D = A / h
D = 640 / 6
D = 80 m

Hence (A) is the correct answer.

**Explanation:**

The area of a trapezium is given by the formula: A = (b1 + b2) * h / 2

Given:

Instruction: A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure? options: A)58.3%, B)62.5%, C)63.5%, D)64.5%, E)65.5%
Output: 

Let I be the income and E be the expenditure.

I = E * 100

If I increases by 20%, then the new income will be:

I = E * 1.2

The new expenditure will be:

E = I * 70%

Substituting the values, we get:

E = I * 70% = I * 0.7

Therefore, the new expenditure will be:

E = I * 0.7 = I * 0.7 * 100% = I * 70%

The answer is:

E = I * 70% = I * 0.7 * 100% = I * 70%

The answer is:

E = I * 70% = I * 0.7 * 100% = I * 70%

The answer is:

E = I * 70% = I * 0.7 * 100% = I * 70%

The answer is:

E = I * 70% = I * 0.7 * 100% = I * 70%

The answer is:

E = I * 70% = I * 0.7 * 100% = I * 70%

The answer is:

E = I * 70% = I * 0.7 * 100% = I * 70%

Output: 

1) The length of the piece is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth. So, the length is 4 times the breadth plus 1m.

2) The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: 2(length + breadth).

3) Substituting the values, we get: 2(4x + x) = 150

4) Simplifying the equation, we get: 2(5x) = 150

5) Solving for x, we get: x = 30

6) The length of the piece is 4 times the breadth plus 1m, which is 4*30 + 1 = 91m.

7) The perimeter of the piece is 2(length + breadth) = 2(91m + 30m) = 2(121m) = 242m.

B) Answer: B

The perimeter of the piece is 2(length + breadth) = 2(121m) = 242m.

The length of the piece is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth. So, the length is 4 times the breadth plus 1m.

The length of the piece is 4*30 + 1 = 91m.

Therefore, the perimeter of the piece is 242m.

Output: 

1. Calculate the speed of the jeep during the forward journey:
Speed = Distance/Time = Distance/6 = Distance/6

2. Calculate the speed of the jeep during the return journey:
Speed = Distance/Time = Distance/4 = Distance/4 + 12km/hr

3. Calculate the distance travelled by the jeep:
Distance = Speed x Time = (Distance/6) + (Distance/4) = (Distance/6) + (Distance/4) + 12km/hr

4. Substitute the values into the formula:
Distance = (Distance/6) + (Distance/4) + 12km/hr
Distance = (Distance/6) + (Distance/4) + 12km/hr
Distance = (Distance/6) + (Distance/4) + 12km/hr
Distance = (Distance/6) + (Distance/4) + 12km/hr
Distance = (Distance/6) + (Distance/4) + 12km/hr
Distance = (Distance/6) + (Distance/4) + 12km/hr
Distance = (Distance/6) + (Distance/4) + 12km/hr
Distance = (Distance/6) + (Distance/4) + 12km/hr
