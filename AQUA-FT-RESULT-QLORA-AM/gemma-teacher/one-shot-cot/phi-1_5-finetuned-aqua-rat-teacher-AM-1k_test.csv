ANSWER:E Answer: E

Instruction: You can purchase one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents, or two sodas and three energy bars for 300
cents. If the costs of the items do not change, compute the cost in cents of six sodas and seven bars. options: A)500, B)600, C)750, D)800, E)900
Output: 

If the cost of one soda is x cents, then the cost of two sodas is 2x cents.

If the cost of one energy bar is y cents, then the cost of three energy bars is 3y cents.

The total cost of six sodas and seven bars is 6x + 7y cents.

We know that the total cost is 150 cents, so we can write the equation:

6x + 7y = 150

To find the cost of six sodas and seven bars, we need to solve for x and y.

We can solve for x by subtracting 7y from both sides of the equation:

6x = 150 - 7y

x = (150 - 7y) / 6

To find the cost of six sodas and seven bars, we substitute x into the equation:

6(150 - 7y) / 6 + 7y = 150

150 - 7y + 7y = 150

150 = 150

The cost of six sodas and seven bars is 500 cents.

ANSWER:B

The cost of six sodas and seven bars is 600 cents.

**Note:** The answer is B, not A.

**Explanation:**

To find the cost of six sodas and seven bars, we need to substitute x into the equation:

Answer: B. Answer: B

Instruction: Find the total no. of distinct bike no.'s that can beformed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s. How many letters need to be distinct? options: A)74453, B)64543, C)74325, D)65000, E)97656
Output: 

To form 2 letters followed by 2 no's, the total number of distinct bike no's is given by the formula:

n(n+1) = n(n+1) - 1

where n is the number of letters and n+1 is the number of no's.

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:

n(n+1) = n(n+1) - 1
n(n+1) = n(n+1) - 1
n(n+1) = n(n+1) - 1
n(n+1) = n(n+1) - 1
n(n+1) = n(n+1) - 1
n(n+1) = n(n+1) - 1
n(n+1) = n(n+1) - 1
n(n+1) = n(n+1) - 1
n(n+1) = n(n+1) - 1
n(n+1) = n(n+1) - 1
n(n+1) = n(n+1) - 1
n(n+1) = n(n+1) - 1
n(n+1) = n(n+1) - 1

Instruction: Boomtown urban planners expect the city’s population to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year? options: A)20%, B)40%, C)50%, D)65%, E)75%
Output: 

The population of Boomtown increased by 10% per year over the last year.

To find the percent population increase, we need to calculate the percentage increase in population over the last year.

Percentage increase = (Population increase / Population at the beginning of the year) x 100%

Percentage increase = (10 / 100) x 100% = 10%

Therefore, the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year is 10%.

Instruction: Two ants are moving from their farms towards each other. Ant A is moving at a speed of 9 cm per hour and ant B is moving at a speed of 6 cm per hour. If the farms are 75 cm away from each other, what will be the distance (in cm) that ant A travels until meeting ant B? options: A)45, B)48, C)51, D)54, E)57
Output: 

The distance that ant A travels before meeting ant B is given by the formula:

Distance = Speed x Time

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:

Distance = 9 x Time

Since the distance between the farms is 75 cm, the time taken by ant A to meet ant B is given by:

Time = Distance / Speed

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:

Time = 75 / 9

Time = 8.33 hours

Therefore, the distance that ant A travels before meeting ant B is:

Distance = 9 x 8.33

Output: If ball A makes 2 rotations in 26 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 13 minutes. If ball B makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 7 minutes.
The two balls start rotating now and makes several rotations before they are at the SAME starting points. Ball A would have done a WHOLE number X of rotations and ball B would have done a WHOLE number Y of rotations. Also they would have rotated during the same period of time T. Hence
T = 13 X = 7 Y
Hence 13 X = 7 Y
Solve the above for X
X = 7 Y / 13
We want the time when they are FIRST at the same starting point. Therefore X and Y are the smallest whole numbers of the equation X = 7 Y / 13. The smallest value of Y that gives X as a whole number is 13. Hence
X = 7 (13) / 13 = 7
Time T is given by
T = 13 X = 13 * 7 = 91 minutes = 1 hour and 31 minutes

Output: 

The ratio of the two numbers is 3:5. If 9 is subtracted from each number, the new numbers are 12 and 23. The smaller number is the number that is in the ratio 3:5. Therefore, the smaller number is 12.

Output: 

The formula for simple interest is given by I = P * r * t, where I is the interest, P is the principal, r is the rate of interest, and t is the time period.

Given that the principal is Rs. 5000, the interest is Rs. 300, and the time period is 3 years, we can substitute these values into the formula to get:

300 = 5000 * r * 3

Solving for r, we get:

r = 300 / (5000 * 3)

r = 0.06

Therefore, the rate of interest per annum is 6%.

Output: 

The ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, which means that for every 4 boys, there are 3 girls. If there are a total of 64 boys and 40 girls, then the number of boys is 4/7 of the total number of members. Therefore, the number of boys is 4/7 x 64 = 32.

The number of girls is 3/7 of the total number of members. Therefore, the number of girls is 3/7 x 64 = 24.

Therefore, the total number of bottles of soda needed for a party with 12 people attending is 12.

C Answer: C

**Note:** The answer is C because the number of bottles of soda needed for a party with 12 people attending is 12.

**End of the question and answer section**

**Explanation:**

To find the number of ways of rearranging the letters of the word ""PROBLEM"" to make 7 letter words, we need to use the formula for permutations. The formula for permutations is given by:

n! / (n-r)!

where n is the total number of letters in the word and r is the number of letters to be filled.

In this case, n = 7 and r = 7, so the number of ways of rearranging the letters of the word ""PROBLEM"" to make 7 letter words is:

7! / (7-7)! = 7! / 0! = 7!

Therefore, the total number of ways of rearranging the letters of the word ""PROBLEM"" to make 7 letter words is 7! ways.

**End of the explanation**

**Explanation","Instruction: In how many ways can the letters of the word ""PROBLEC"" be rearranged to make 7 letter words such that none of the letters repeat? options: A)2!, B)3!, C)7!, D)8!, E)9!

Output: 

The minimum selling price per component is $226.

The total revenue from sales is 420 x $226 = $8,072,000.

The total production cost is 420 x $110 = $5,040,000.

The yearly profit is $8,072,000 - $5,040,000 = $3,012,000.

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component is $226.

The answer is: C

The total revenue from sales is 420 x $226 = $8,072,000.

The total production cost is 420 x $110 = $5,040,000.

Instruction: The monthly salary S of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. What should the monthly sales be so that her monthly salary reaches $1500? options: A)$50000, B)$40000, C)$30000, D)$20000, E)None of these
Output: 

The monthly salary S of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales.

So, the formula for monthly salary is S = 500 + 0.05S

We need to find the monthly sales (S) that will make S = $1500.

S = 500 + 0.05S

1500 = 500 + 0.05S

0.05S = 1000

S = $20,000

Answer: B) $40000

Explanation: The monthly salary S of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. To find the monthly sales (S) that will make S = $1500, we need to solve the equation S = 500 + 0.05S for S.

S = 500 + 0.05S

1500 = 500 + 0.05S

0.05S = 1000

S = $20,000

Therefore, the monthly sales should be $20,000 to reach a monthly salary of $1500.

The answer is: B) $40000

The answer is: B) $40000

Output: 

The formula for the area of a regular pentagon is A = (1/4)πr^2, where r is the radius of the pentagon.

The radius of the pentagon is half the length of the side of the quadrilateral.

Therefore, the number of different quadrilaterals that can be formed is given by the formula:

n = (1/4)πr^2

where n is the number of quadrilaterals and r is the radius of the pentagon.

Substituting the values of r and n into the formula, we get:

n = (1/4)π(r^2)

n = (1/4)πr^2

n = (1/4)πr^2

n = (1/4)πr^2

n = (1/4)πr^2

n = (1/4)πr^2

n = (1/4)πr^2

n = (1/4)πr^2

n = (1/4)πr^2

n = (1/4)πr^2

n = (1/4)πr^2

n = (1/4)πr^2

Instruction: What will be the cost of gardening 1-metre – broad boundary around a rectangular plot having perimeter of 340 metres at the rate of 10 per square metre? options: A)3400, B)1700, C)3440, D)Cannot be determined, E)None of these
Output: 

The cost of gardening 1-metre – broad boundary around a rectangular plot having perimeter of 340 metres at the rate of 10 per square metre is:

1. Calculate the area of the rectangular plot:

Perimeter = 2(length + width)
340 = 2(length + width)

Divide both sides by 2:

170 = length + width

2. Calculate the cost of gardening 1-metre – broad boundary:

Cost = 10 × area

Substitute the value of length and width:

Cost = 10 × (170/2)

Cost = 10 × 85

Cost = 850

Answer: A) 3400

The cost of gardening 1-metre – broad boundary around a rectangular plot having perimeter of 340 metres at the rate of 10 per square metre is 3400.

**Explanation:**

The cost of gardening 1-metre – broad boundary is calculated by multiplying the area of the rectangular plot by the cost per square metre.

Output: 

The space shuttle travels 700m in 40 seconds, so its speed is 700/40 = 17.5m/s.

It will take 5 seconds to pass a point, so the time taken to travel the length of the space shuttle is 5 seconds.

Therefore, the length of the space shuttle is 17.5m/s x 5 seconds = 87.5m.

B Answer: B

The space shuttle travels 700m in 40 seconds, so its speed is 700/40 = 17.5m/s.

It will take 5 seconds to pass a point, so the time taken to travel the length of the space shuttle is 5 seconds.

Therefore, the length of the space shuttle is 17.5m/s x 5 seconds = 87.5m.

The answer is: B

The length of the space shuttle is 87.5m.

**Note:** The answer is B because the space shuttle travels 700m in 40 seconds, so its speed is 700/40 = 17.5m/s. It will take 5 seconds to pass a point, so the time taken to travel the length of the space shuttle is 5 seconds. Therefore, the length of the space shuttle is 17.5m/s x 5 seconds = 87.5m.

Answer C Answer: C

Instruction: Joe's age, Joe's sister's age and Joe’s fathers age sums up to 100. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Find the age of Joe's father? options: A)45, B)48, C)50, D)55, E)58
Output: 

Let Joe's age be J, his sister's age be S, and his father's age be F.

We know that J + S + F = 100.

When Joe is as old as his father, J = F.

When Joe is as old as his father, S = 2F.

Substituting J = F into the first equation, we get:

F + S + F = 100
2F + S = 100
S = 100 - 2F

Substituting S = 100 - 2F into the second equation, we get:

F = 100 - 2F
F = 100

Therefore, Joe's father is 100 years old.

Answer: B) 48

**Note:** The answer is B) 48.

**Explanation:**

1. We know that J + S + F = 100.
2. When Joe is as old as his father, J = F.
3. When Joe is as old as his father, S = 2F.
4. Substituting J = F into the first equation, we get:

F + S + F = 100
2F + S = 100
S = 100 - 2F

5. Substituting S = 100 - 2F into the second equation, we get:

F = 100 - 2F

Question 1: A store sells apples for $0.50 each and oranges for $0.75 each. If a customer buys 3 apples and 4 oranges, how much does the customer spend in total?

Solution:
To find the total amount spent, we need to multiply the number of apples by the price per apple, and the number of oranges by the price per orange, and then add the two amounts together.

Number of apples = 3
Price per apple = $0.50

Number of oranges = 4
Price per orange = $0.75
