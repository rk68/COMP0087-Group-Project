Instruction: Boomtown urban planners expect the city’s population to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year? options: A)20%, B)40%, C)50%, D)65%, E)75%
Output: 

The population of Boomtown is expected to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago.

To find the percent population increase, we need to calculate the percentage increase in population over one year.

Percentage increase = (New population - Old population) / Old population * 100%

Percentage increase = (New population - Old population) / Old population * 100%

If the population of Boomtown is expected to increase by 10% per year over the next two years, then the percentage increase in population over one year would be 10%.

Instruction: A coin made of alloy of aluminum and silver measures 2 x 15 mm (it is 2 mm thick and its diameter is 15 mm). If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum? options: A)36 grams, B)40 grams, C)42 grams, D)48 grams, E)50 grams
Output: 

The weight of the coin is 30 grams. The volume of aluminum in the alloy is equal to that of silver, so the weight of the coin will be twice the weight of the coin made of pure aluminum.

The weight of the coin made of pure aluminum is 30 grams. Therefore, the weight of the coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum will be:

Weight of coin = 30 grams

The volume of aluminum in the alloy is equal to that of silver, so the weight of the coin will be twice the weight of the coin made of pure aluminum.

Weight of coin = 30 grams

Volume of aluminum in the alloy = 2 x 15 mm = 30 mm

Weight of coin = 30 grams

The volume of aluminum in the alloy is equal to that of silver, so the weight of the coin will be twice the weight of the coin made of pure aluminum.

Weight of coin = 30 grams

The volume of aluminum in the alloy is equal to that of silver, so the weight of the coin will be twice the weight of the coin made of pure aluminum.

Weight of coin = 30 grams

Instruction: Two ants are moving from their farms towards each other. Ant A is moving at a speed of 9 cm per hour and ant B is moving at a speed of 6 cm per hour. If the farms are 75 cm away from each other, what will be the distance (in cm) that ant A travels until meeting ant B? options: A)45, B)48, C)51, D)54, E)57
Output: 

The distance that ant A travels is given by the formula:

Distance = Speed x Time

where Distance is the distance traveled, Speed is the speed of the ant, and Time is the time taken to travel the distance.

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:

Distance traveled by Ant A = 9 x Time

Distance traveled by Ant B = 6 x Time

Since the farms are 75 cm away from each other, the distance traveled by Ant A will be equal to the distance traveled by Ant B.

Therefore, the distance traveled by Ant A will be:

Distance traveled by Ant A = Distance traveled by Ant B

Distance traveled by Ant A = 6 x Time

Distance traveled by Ant A = 6 x Time

Distance traveled by Ant A = 6 x Time

Distance traveled by Ant A = 6 x Time

Distance traveled by Ant A = 6 x Time

Distance traveled by Ant A = 6 x Time

Distance traveled by Ant A = 6 x Time

Distance traveled by Ant A = 6 x Time

Distance traveled by Ant A = 6 x Time

Distance traveled by Ant A = 6 x Time

Distance traveled by Ant A = 6 x Time

Distance traveled by Ant A = 6 x Time

Distance traveled by Ant A = 6 x Time

Distance traveled by Ant A = 6 x Time

Instruction: The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost? options: A)20%, B)28%, C)36%, D)40%, E)42%
Output: 

1. Calculate the original retail price of the appliance.
2. Calculate the wholesale cost of the appliance.
3. Calculate the discount on the original retail price.
4. Calculate the selling price of the appliance.
5. Calculate the percentage increase in the selling price compared to the wholesale cost.

The original retail price is 60% more than the wholesale cost, which means that the selling price is 120% of the wholesale cost.

The discount on the original retail price is 20%, which means that the selling price is 80% of the original retail price.

The selling price is 80% of 120% of the wholesale cost, which is equal to 0.8 * 120% = 96% of the wholesale cost.

The percentage increase in the selling price compared to the wholesale cost is 96% - 120% = -4%.

Output: If ball A makes 2 rotations in 26 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 13 minutes. If ball B makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 7 minutes.
The two balls start rotating now and makes several rotations before they are at the SAME starting points. Ball A would have done a WHOLE number X of rotations and ball B would have done a WHOLE number Y of rotations. Also they would have rotated during the same period of time T. Hence
T = 13 X = 7 Y
Hence 13 X = 7 Y
Solve the above for X
X = 7 Y / 13
We want the time when they are FIRST at the same starting point. Therefore X and Y are the smallest whole numbers of the equation X = 7 Y / 13. The smallest value of Y that gives X as a whole number is 13. Hence
X = 7 (13) / 13 = 7

Output: 
If the ratio of two numbers is 3:5, then the ratio of the new numbers is 12:23. If 9 is subtracted from each number, the new numbers are 12 and 23. Therefore, the smaller number is 12.
Solve the above for X
X = 12

Instruction: A car finishes a journey in 20 hours at the speed of 60 km/hr. If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, how much speed does the car gain? options: A)80 kmph, B)50 kmph, C)120 kmph, D)70 kmph, E)80 kmph
Output: 
The speed of the car is directly proportional to the time taken to cover the distance. So, if the time taken is reduced, the speed of the car will increase.

If the car finishes the journey in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/hr, then the distance covered is 60 km/hr * 20 hours = 1200 km.

If the same distance is to be covered in 10 hours, then the speed of the car will increase. So, the speed of the car will be 120 km/hr * 10 hours = 1200 km/hr.

The answer is: B

The answer is: The speed of the car is 50 km/hr.

Output: 

The formula for simple interest is given by the formula I = P * r * t, where I is the interest, P is the principal, r is the rate of interest, and t is the time period.

Given information:
P = Rs. 5000
I = Rs. 300
t = 3 years

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
300 = 5000 * r * 3

Solving for r, we get:
r = 300 / 5000 * 3 = 0.06

Instruction: [5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6 options: A)4, B)4.5, C)5, D)5.5, E)6.5
Output: 

The question is asking for the value of the variable that completes the equation.

The equation is:

(5 +? × 19 - 15 - 7) / (13 × 13 - 156) = 6

To solve for the variable, we need to isolate the variable on one side of the equation.

First, we can simplify the left side of the equation by multiplying the entire equation by 13:

(5 +? × 19 - 15 - 7) = 13 × 6

Next, we can distribute the 13 to the terms on the left side of the equation:

5 + 19 - 15 - 7 = 13 × 6

5 + 13 - 15 - 7 = 13 × 6

5 + 13 - 15 - 7 = 13 × 6

5 + 13 - 15 - 7 = 13 × 6

5 + 13 - 15 - 7 = 13 × 6

5 + 13 - 15 - 7 = 13 × 6

5 + 13 - 15 - 7 = 13 × 6

5 + 13 - 15 - 7 = 13 × 6

5 + 13 - 15 - 7 = 13 × 6

5 + 13 - 15 - 7 = 13 × 6

5 + 13 - 15 - 7 = 13 × 6

5 + 13 - 15 - 7 = 13 × 6

5 + 13 - 15 - 7 = 13 × 6

5 + 13 -","Instruction: Last year, 34 percent of Ace Book Company's sales revenue came from the sale of novels. Of the remaining revenue, 1/3 was from the sale of biographies.

Instruction: If 6 yrs are subtracted from the present age of Ajay and the remainder is divided by 18, then the present age of Rahul is obtained. If Rahul is 2 yrs younger to Denis whose age is 5 yrs, then what is Ajay's present age? options: A)40, B)60, C)70, D)80, E)90
Output: 

The present age of Ajay is 5 years.

Number of years subtracted from the present age of Ajay = 6

Number of years remaining = 5 - 6 = -1

Number of years remaining is divisible by 18

Number of years remaining = -1/18 = -0.04

Number of years remaining = -0.04 * -1 = 0.04

Number of years remaining = 0.04

Number of years remaining = 0.04 + 2 = 2

Number of years remaining = 2 - 5 = -3

Number of years remaining = -3/18 = -0.16

Number of years remaining = -0.16 * -1 = 0.16

Number of years remaining = 0.16 + 5 = 5.16

Instruction: A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point. options: A)238, B)289, C)200, D)287, E)187
Output: 

The speed of the ship is 180 miles per hour. The speed of the plane is 10 times the speed of the ship, which is 180 x 10 = 1800 miles per hour.

The time taken by the ship to travel 180 miles is 180/180 = 1 hour.

The time taken by the plane to travel 180 miles is 180/1800 = 1/10 hour.

When they meet, the distance traveled by the ship and the plane is equal to the distance traveled by the plane alone, which is 1800 miles.

Therefore, the distance traveled by the plane alone is 1800 miles.

The distance traveled by the ship alone is 180 miles.

The distance traveled by the plane and the ship is equal to the distance traveled by the plane alone, which is 1800 miles.

So, the distance traveled by the plane and the ship is equal to the distance traveled by the plane alone, which is 1800 miles.

The distance traveled by the plane and the ship is equal to the distance traveled by the plane alone, which is 1800 miles.

Therefore, the distance traveled by the plane and the ship is equal to the distance traveled by the plane alone, which is 1800 miles.

The distance traveled by the plane and the ship is equal to the distance traveled by the plane alone, which is 1800 miles.

So, the distance traveled by the plane and the ship is equal to the distance traveled by the plane","Instruction: A father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan who are 23 and 24 at present.

Instruction: At a conference, one team is made up of 4 men and 4 women. Four presenters are chosen to present the team's findings in front of the entire conference. How many different groups of presenters can be chosen from the team if a team cannot be composed of men only or women only? (Two groups of presenters are considered different if at least one presenter is different.) options: A)120, B)19, C)180, D)420, E)460
Output: 

To choose a group of presenters from a team of 4 men and 4 women, there are a total of 4 x 4 = 16 different ways to choose the first presenter.

For the second presenter, there are a total of 4 x 4 = 16 different ways to choose the second presenter.

For the third presenter, there are a total of 4 x 4 = 16 different ways to choose the third presenter.

For the fourth presenter, there are a total of 4 x 4 = 16 different ways to choose the fourth presenter.

Therefore, the total number of different groups of presenters that can be chosen from the team is 16 x 16 x 16 x 16 = 16,384.

Output: 

The simple interest is given by the formula I = P*r*t, where I is the simple interest, P is the principal, r is the rate of interest, and t is the time period.

Substituting the values into the formula, we get I = 5000*0.12*2 = Rs. 1200

The C.I. is given by the formula C.I. = P*r*t, where C.I. is the C.I. at the same rate for Rs. 5000 for 2 years in Rs.72.

Substituting the values into the formula, we get C.I. = 5000*0.12*2 = Rs. 1200

The difference between simple interest and C.I. is Rs. 1200 - Rs. 1200 = 0

Output: 

The length of the ribbon was originally 30 cm. It was reduced in the ratio 5 : 3.

To find the length of the ribbon after the reduction, we need to find the new length of the ribbon after the reduction.

The new length of the ribbon after the reduction is 5/3 times the original length of the ribbon.

New length of the ribbon = 5/3 * 30 = 20 cm

Therefore, the length of the ribbon after the reduction is 20 cm.

Instruction: The ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which will fit inside the cube is? options: A)2: π, B)7:2, C)8:2, D)6: π, E)8:3
Output: 

The volume of a cube is given by the formula V = s^3, where V is the volume, s is the length of the side of the cube, and π is a constant.

The volume of a sphere is given by the formula V = (4/3)πr^3, where V is the volume, r is the radius of the sphere, and π is a constant.

The ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which will fit inside the cube is V/V_sphere = s^3/r^3.

Substituting the values of V and V_sphere into the equation, we get:

s^3/r^3 = V/V_sphere

s^3/r^3 = V/π

s^3/r^3 = V/π

Therefore, the ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which will fit inside the cube is V/π.

Output: 

The number of ways to arrange the books is given by the formula for permutations of n objects taken r at a time.

The formula is given by:

P(n,r) = n! / (n-r)!

where n is the total number of objects and r is the number of objects taken at a time.

In this case, n = 6 and r = 6.

P(6,6) = 6! / (6-6)! = 6! / 0! = 6! = 720

Instruction: Joe's age, Joe's sister's age and Joe’s fathers age sums up to 100. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Find the age of Joe's father? options: A)45, B)48, C)50, D)55, E)58
Output: 
Let Joe's age be x, his sister's age be y and father's age be z.

Given,
x + y + z = 100

When Joe is as old as his father,
x = z

When Joe is as old as his father,
y = 2z

Substituting the value of x in the first equation, we get:
y + y + z = 100
2y + z = 100

Substituting the value of y in the second equation, we get:
2y = 2z

Solving for z, we get:
z = 50

Therefore, Joe's father is 50 years old.

Instruction: The cross-section of a canal is shaped like a trapezium. If the canal is 10 m wide at the top and 6 m wide at the bottom and the area of cross-section is 640 square meters, the depth of cannel is? options: A)26, B)28, C)21, D)80, E)23
Output: 
The area of a trapezium is given by the formula A = (b1 + b2) * h / 2, where A is the area, b1 and b2 are the bases, and h is the height.
Given that the area of cross-section is 640 square meters, and the width of the canal is 10 m at the top and 6 m at the bottom, we can find the height of the canal by rearranging the formula as h = 2 * A / (b1 + b2).
Substituting the values of A and b1 and b2 into the formula, we get h = 2 * 640 / (10 + 6) = 20 meters.
Therefore, the depth of the canal is 20 meters.
The answer is: B) 28

**Note:** The answer is B) 28.

**End of the section:**

In this section, we learned about the concept of cross-section and how it is used to find the depth of a canal. We also learned how to find the area of a trapezium using the formula A = (b1 + b2) * h / 2.

After finding the height of the canal, we can use the formula h = 2 * A / (b1 + b2) to find the depth of the canal.

Output: 

The length of the rectangular piece is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth. So, the length is 4 times the breadth plus 1m.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + b).

Substituting the values of l and b into the formula, we get P = 2(4(b) + 1) = 2(4b + 1) = 8b + 2m
