Instruction: You can purchase one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents, or two sodas and three energy bars for 300
cents. If the costs of the items do not change, compute the cost in cents of six sodas and seven bars. options: A)500, B)600, C)750, D)800, E)900
Output: 

The cost of one soda is 150 cents, and the cost of two energy bars is 300 cents. Therefore, the cost of six sodas is 6 * 150 = 900 cents.

The cost of two sodas is 2 * 150 = 300 cents. Therefore, the cost of seven energy bars is 7 * 300 = 2100 cents.

The total cost of six sodas and seven energy bars is 900 + 2100 = 3000 cents.

The cost of six sodas and seven energy bars is 3000 cents.

Output: 

**Explanation:**

To form a distinct bike no. using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s, we need to choose 2 letters from a total of 26 letters and 2 no.'s from a total of 2 no.'s.

**Step 1:** Choose 2 letters from 26 letters.

There are 26 letters in total, so the number of distinct letters that can be formed is 26C2 = 26.

**Step 2:** Choose 2 no.'s from 2 no.'s.

There are 2 no.'s in total, so the number of distinct no.s that can be formed is 2C2 = 2.

Output: 

**Explanation:**

To reach a salary of at least $1000, the sales person must make a total of at least $1000 in sales.

To find the number of sales required to reach a salary of at least $1000, we need to divide the salary by the commission rate.

The commission rate is 10%, which means that for each sale, the sales person will earn 10% of the sale price as commission.

To find the number of sales required to reach a salary of at least $1000, we need to divide the salary by the commission rate.

$1000 / 10% = 1000 sales

Therefore, the sales person must make a total of 1000 sales in order to reach a salary of at least $1000.

Instruction: 64 boys and 40 girls form a group for social work. During their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. How many members does the group have now, if the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3? options: A)277, B)288, C)200, D)277, E)168
Output: 

The ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, which means that for every 4 boys, there are 3 girls. So, if there are a total of 64 boys and 40 girls, then the number of boys in the group is 4/7 of the total number of members. Therefore, the number of boys in the group is 4/7 * 64 = 32.

The number of girls in the group is 3/7 of the total number of members, which is 3/7 * 40 = 12.

The total number of members in the group is 32 + 12 = 44.

Therefore, the probability of the man catching the first train is 44/64 = 0.75.

Instruction: If a man rows at the rate of 4 kmph in still water and his rate against the current is 2 kmph, then the man's rate along the current is: options: A)15 kmph, B)6 kmph, C)12 kmph, D)14 kmph, E)6 kmph
Output: 

The capacity of a tank of dimensions (8 m × 6 m × 2.5 m) is 120 litres.

The man's rate against the current is 2 kmph.

Therefore, the man's rate along the current is:

2 kmph - 4 kmph = -2 kmph

The negative sign indicates that the man is moving against the current.

The formula for the rate of a moving object is:

Rate = Distance/Time

The distance is the product of the dimensions of the tank, which is 8 m × 6 m × 2.5 m = 120 m.

The time is the product of the speed and the time, which is 120 m/2 kmph = 60 seconds.

Therefore, the rate of the man is:

Rate = 120 m/60 s = 2 kmph

The answer is: D

The answer is: The capacity of a tank of dimensions (8 m × 6 m × 2.5 m) is 120 litres. The man's rate against the current is 2 kmph.

Output: 

**Explanation:**

Given information:
n = 36, x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4)

We know that the number of students who took physics is 20% of the total number of students, which is 20% of 36 = 0.2 * 36 = 7.2.

Similarly, the number of students who took math is 28% of the total number of students, which is 28% of 36 = 0.28 * 36 = 8.4.

Therefore, the number of students who took physics and math is 7.2 + 8.4 = 15.6.

The least possible number of students in the school is the number of students who took physics and math, which is 15.6.

Output: 

**Explanation:**

1. Calculate the distance traveled by Ram and Krishna in 10 seconds.
Distance traveled by Ram = 20m/s * 10s = 200 meters
Distance traveled by Krishna = 40m/s * 10s = 400 meters

2. Find the relative speed of Ram and Krishna.
Relative speed = 20m/s + 40m/s = 60m/s

3. Calculate the time taken by Ram and Krishna to meet each other.
Time taken = 10s

4. Find the distance traveled by Ram and Krishna before meeting each other.
Distance traveled by Ram = 200 meters
Distance traveled by Krishna = 400 meters

Output: 

The formula for the height of a tree is given by the formula:

h = 2s/h

where h is the height of the tree, s is the height of the pole, and h is the height of the shadow.

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:

h = 2(15)/10 = 3 metres

Therefore, the height of the tree is 3 metres.

The area of the sheet is given by the formula:

A = lw

where A is the area of the sheet, l is the length of the sheet, and w is the width of the sheet.

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:

A = l(l) = l^2

Substituting the value of l into the formula, we get:

l^2 = l(l) = l^2

Therefore, the area of the sheet is l^2.

The area of the sheet is equal to the area of the tree, which is 15 square metres.

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = lw, where A is the area, l is the length, and w is the width.

We know that the area of the yard is 240 square meters, so we can write the equation as:

240 = 10w

Solving for w, we get:

w = 24

Therefore, the length of the yard is 24 meters.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2l + 2w, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

Substituting the value of w into the formula, we get:

Output: 

**Explanation:**

To obtain the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and vitamin A, the health food must contain at least 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A.

To calculate the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E, we need to find the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E per gram of health food. This can be done by dividing the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E by the percentage of vitamin E in the health food.

Minimum daily requirement of vitamin E per gram of health food = 9% / 0.09 = 100 grams

To calculate the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A, we need to find the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A per gram of health food. This can be done by dividing the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A by the percentage of vitamin A in the health food.

Minimum daily requirement of vitamin A per gram of health food = 8% / 0.08 = 125 grams

Therefore, the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and vitamin A is 100 grams and 125 grams, respectively.

**The answer is:** A) 15

Output: 

The monthly salary S of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. To find the monthly sales, we need to solve the equation:

S = 500 + 0.05S

where S is the monthly salary and 0.05S is the monthly sales.

We want to find the value of S that makes S = $1500, so we need to find the value of S that satisfies the equation:

1500 = 500 + 0.05S

S = $3000

Output: 

The original length of the ribbon was 30 cm. It was reduced in the ratio 5 : 3.

To find the length of the ribbon after reduction, we need to find the new length in terms of the original length.

The new length is given by the formula:

New length = Original length * (Reduction ratio / (Reduction ratio + 1))

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:

New length = 30 * (5 / (5 + 3)) = 18

Therefore, the length of the ribbon after reduction is 18 cm.

The ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which will fit inside the cube is V/V_sphere = s^3/r^3.

If V_sphere is equal to the volume of the sphere, then the ratio of the volumes of the cube to that of the sphere is V/V_sphere = s^3/r^3.

If V_sphere is greater than the volume of the sphere, then the ratio of the volumes of the cube to that of the sphere is V/V_sphere = s^3/r^3.

If V_sphere is less than the volume of the sphere, then the ratio of the volumes of the cube to that of the sphere is V/V_sphere = s^","Instruction: Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph.

Output: 

The points A,B,C,D,E and F form a regular pentagon. To form a quadrilateral, we need to choose 4 points from the pentagon.

The number of ways to choose 4 points from the pentagon is given by the formula:

nC4 = n! / (4!(n-4)!)

where n is the number of points in the pentagon.

Substituting the values of n into the formula, we get:

nC4 = 5! / (4!(5-4)!) = 5! / (4!1!) = 5

Therefore, the total number of quadrilaterals that can be formed by joining 4 of the points A,B,C,D,E and F is 5.

Instruction: Joe's age, Joe's sister's age and Joe’s fathers age sums up to 100. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Find the age of Joe's father? options: A)45, B)48, C)50, D)55, E)58
Output: 

Joe's age = 100 - (2 * Sister's age)

Sister's age = 100 - (2 * Father's age)

Father's age = 2 * Sister's age

Substituting the values of Sister's age and Father's age in the equation, we get:

100 - (2 * Father's age) = 2 * Sister's age

Father's age = 2 * Sister's age - 100

Substituting the value of Sister's age in the equation, we get:

Father's age = 2 * (100 - Sister's age) - 100

Father's age = 2 * 100 - 2 * Sister's age

Father's age = 200 - 2 * Sister's age

Therefore, the cost of gardening 1-metre – broad boundary around a rectangular plot having perimeter of 340 metres at the rate of 10 per square metre is:

Father's age = 200 - 2 * Sister's age

The cost of gardening 1-metre – broad boundary around a rectangular plot having perimeter of 340 metres at the rate of 10 per square metre is:

Cost = 200 - 2 * Sister's age

Output: 

**Explanation:**

1. Arrange the children on the chairs in a straight line.
2. Susan is on the left of Tim.
3. There are 3 ways to arrange the children on the chairs.

**The answer is:** D

The total number of ways to arrange the children on the chairs is 3! = 6.

The number of ways to arrange the children on the chairs so that Susan is on the left of Tim is 3! - 1 = 6.

Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange the children on the chairs is 6.

The price at which the retailer sold the appliance is $63.00.

**The answer is:** C

The total cost of the appliance is $20.00.

Output: 

**Step 1: Calculate the savings per issue:**

Savings per issue = 25% of cover price = 0.25 * cover price

**Step 2: Calculate the cost per issue:**

Cost per issue = cover price - savings per issue = $42.00 - 0.25 * cover price

**Step 3: Substitute the value of the perimeter into the formula:**

$340 = $42.00 - 0.25 * cover price

**Step 4: Solve for the cover price:**

$340 = $42.00 - 0.25 * cover price
$42.00 = $42.00 + 0.25 * cover price
$42.00 - $42.00 = 0.25 * cover price
$0 = 0.25 * cover price

**Step 5: Calculate the cover price:**

$0 = 0.25 * cover price
$0 = 0

Output: 

The length of the rectangular piece is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth. So, the length is 4 times the breadth plus 1m.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:

Perimeter = 2(length + breadth)

Substituting the values of length and breadth into the formula, we get:

Perimeter = 2(4(breadth) + 1m)

Perimeter = 2(4(breadth) + 4m)

Output: 

The sum of the digits of a three digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109. If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order.

To find the number, we need to find the number that satisfies the following conditions:

1. The sum of the digits of the number is 17.
2. The sum of the squares of the digits of the number is 109.
3. The number is written in the reverse order.

To find the number, we can start by finding the number that satisfies the first condition. The number that has a sum of digits of 17 is 369.

To find the number that satisfies the second condition, we need to find the number that has a sum of squares of digits of 109. The number that has a sum of squares of digits of 109 is 377.

To find the number that satisfies the third condition, we need to find the number that has the same digits written in the reverse order. The number that has the same digits written in the reverse order is 369.

Therefore, the number is 369.

Output: 

The cost of repairing the current tires is $40 per tire, and the new tires cost $180 per tire. Therefore, the cost of repairing the current tires is $40 x 4 = $160 per year. The cost of the new tires is $180 x 4 = $720 per year. The average cost per year of the new tires is $720 - $160 = $520 per year. The percentage increase in cost per year is $720 - $160 = $520 per year - $160 = $400 per year. The percentage increase in cost per year is $400 per year / $160 per year x 100% = 25%.

The answer is: D) 24

The answer is: 24. The cost of repairing the current tires is $40 per tire, and the new tires cost $180 per tire. Therefore, the cost of repairing the current tires is $40 x 4 = $160 per year. The cost of the new tires is $180 x 4 = $720 per year. The average cost per year of the new tires is $720 - $160 = $520 per year.

Instruction: The sum of k consecutive integers is 51. If the least integer is -50, then k = options: A)40, B)62, C)82, D)92, E)102
Output: 

The sum of k consecutive integers is 51, and the least integer is -50. So, the least integer is -50.

The formula for the sum of k consecutive integers is given by the formula:

S = (k/2)(a + l)

where S is the sum of k consecutive integers, k is the number of consecutive integers, a is the first integer, and l is the last integer.

Substituting the values of k, a, and l into the formula, we get:

S = (k/2)(-50 + l)

Since the sum of k consecutive integers is 51, we can write:

51 = (k/2)(-50 + l)

Solving for l, we get:

l = 51 - (k/2)(-50)

Therefore, the least integer is -50 + (k/2)(-50) = -50 + (-25)k = -25k.

Output: 

The formula for the time taken to travel a distance is given by the formula:

Time = Distance/Speed

where Distance is the distance traveled, Speed is the speed of the car, and Time is the time taken to travel the distance.

Given that the distance traveled is 1400 grams, the speed of the car is unknown. Therefore, we cannot calculate the time taken to travel the distance.

The angle of elevation is changing from 45° to 60°, which means that the distance traveled is changing from 1400 grams to 1200 grams.

The time taken to travel 1200 grams is 1200/Speed.

The time taken to travel 1200 grams is 1200/Speed = 1200/Speed

Therefore, the time taken to reach the base of the tower is 1200/Speed = 1200/Speed + 10 minutes.

Output: 

**Explanation:**

The formula for the time taken to pass through a drain is given by the formula:

t = (w/25) * y

where t is the time taken, w is the rate of flow, and y is the volume of the drain.

If the current population of the city is 78000, then the population of the city will increase by 5% annually. Therefore, the new population of the city will be 78000 + 5% of 78000 = 78000 + 30000 = 85800.

**The answer is:** B

The total time taken to pass through the drain will be 85800/w = 1200x seconds. Therefore, the time taken to pass through the drain will be 1200x seconds.

Instruction: Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other? options: A)3 hours, B)5 hours, C)6 hours, D)4 hours, E)7 hours
Output: 

The formula for calculating the time taken by a car to travel a certain distance is given by the formula:

Time = Distance/Speed

where Distance is the distance traveled by the car, and Speed is the speed of the car.

We know that the distance traveled by the first car is 15 miles, and the speed of the first car is 55 mph. So, we can substitute these values into the formula as follows:

Time = 15/55 = 0.27 hours

The time taken by the second car to travel the same distance is 12 miles, and the speed of the second car is 52 mph. So, we can substitute these values into the formula as follows:

Time = 12/52 = 0.25 hours

The time taken by the second car to travel the same distance is 0.25 hours, which is equivalent to 25 minutes.

Therefore, the answer is B) 61 hours.

Output: 

**Step 1: Convert the weight of the bag of cat food to ounces.**

7 pounds and 4 ounces is equivalent to 112 ounces.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of defective staplers.**

10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective, so the number of defective staplers is 10% of the total number of staplers produced.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of non-defective staplers.**

The number of non-defective staplers is the total number of staplers produced minus the number of defective staplers.

**Step 4: Calculate the number of rejected staplers.**

2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake, so the number of rejected staplers is 2% of the total number of non-defective staplers.

Output: 

The formula for compound interest is given by the formula:

A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

where A is the amount of money invested, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year, and t is the number of years.

We know that the sum of the digits of a three-digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109. So, we can write the following equations:

S = 17
S^2 = 109

We also know that the sum of the digits of a three-digit number is equal to the sum of the squares of its digits. So, we can write the following equation:

S = S^2

Substituting the value of S from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

17 = S^2

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

S = √17

S = 4

Now, we can substitute the value of S into the formula for compound interest:

Output: 

**Explanation:**

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2l + 2w, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

For the first part of the sheet, the length is l = 48/2 = 24cm and the width is w = 48/2 = 24cm. Therefore, the area of the first part is A = 24*24 = 576 square cm.

For the second part of the sheet, the length is l = 66/2 = 33cm and the width is w = 66/2 = 33cm. Therefore, the area of the second part is A = 33*33 = 1320 square cm.

**The answer is:** A) 1584

The total area of the sheet is 576 + 1320 = 1792 square cm.

**Step 1:** Find the square of the sum of the numbers.

The sum of the numbers is 1000, so the square of the sum is 1000^2 = 1,000,000.

**Step 2:** Find the square of the difference between the squares of the numbers.

The difference between the squares of the numbers is 256000, so the square of the difference is 256000^2 = 1,000,000.

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = lw, where A is the area, l is the length, and w is the width.

We know that the area of the yard is 3,000 square feet, and one side of the yard is 100 feet wide. So, we can write the equation as:

100w = 3,000

Solving for w, we get:

w = 30

Therefore, the length of the other side of the yard is 30 feet.

Instruction: How many ways A boy can reach the top of stairs which contain 10 steps, when he can take either one or two steps every time? options: A)88, B)89, C)90, D)91, E)92
Output: 

The boy can take either one or two steps every time, so he can reach the top of the stairs in a total of 2 ways.

The number of ways to arrange the 10 steps is 10! = 10 x 9 x 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 10,000 ways.

The number of ways to arrange the 10 steps with one step taken every time is 10! / (10 - 1) = 10,000 ways.

Therefore, the number of ways to arrange the 10 steps with one step taken every time is 10,000 / 10 = 1000 ways.

The number of ways to arrange the 10 steps with two steps taken every time is 10! / (10 - 2) = 10,000 ways.

The number of ways to arrange the 10 steps with two steps taken every time is 10,000 / 10 = 1000 ways.

The number of ways to arrange the 10 steps with one step taken every time is 10,000 / 10 = 1000 ways.

The number of ways to arrange the 10 steps with two steps taken every time is 10,000 / 10 = 1000 ways.

The answer is:","Instruction: Anna has 4 books. If she decide to arrange the 4 books in every possible combination and moved just one book every minute, how long would it taken by her ? options: A)22 minutes, B)30 minutes, C)15 minutes, D)24 minutes, E)35 minutes

Output: 

The time at which the bells will ring together is given by the formula:

t = 36s + 40s + 48s

where t is the time in seconds and s is the time interval in seconds.

Substituting the values of s into the formula, we get:

t = 36(6) + 40(6) + 48(6)

t = 216 + 240 + 288

t = 864 seconds

Therefore, the time at which the bells will ring together is 864 seconds.

The probability that Mr.Jain selected the winning horse is given by the formula:

P(win) = 1/5

where P(win) is the probability of winning and 1 is the probability of selecting the winning horse.

Substituting the values of P(win) into the formula, we get:

P(win) = 1/5

Therefore, the probability that Mr.Jain selected the winning horse is 1/5.

Output: 

The mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay. To make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand, we need to remove the same amount of sand and replace it with pure sand.

To find the amount of sand to be removed, we first need to find the volume of sand in the mixture. The volume of sand in the mixture is 10kg x 30% = 3kg.

To find the volume of sand to be replaced, we need to find the volume of sand in the mixture. The volume of sand to be replaced is 3kg x 1 = 3kg.

Therefore, the amount of sand to be removed is 3kg and the amount of sand to be replaced is 3kg.

The total volume of the mixture after the removal and replacement is 10kg - 3kg + 3kg = 10kg.

The number of faces of the smaller cubes remaining unpainted is 10kg x 10% = 1.5 faces.

Output: 

The area of a triangle is given by the formula A = (1/2)bh, where A is the area, b is the base, and h is the height.

If a>x>b>0>y, then the base is b and the height is y.

Therefore, the area of the triangle is A = (1/2)(b)(y) = (1/2)(b)(y) = (1/2)(b)(y)

The highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money in order to take advantage of the discount is the area of the triangle divided by the base.

The area of the triangle is given by the formula A = (1/2)bh, where A is the area, b is the base, and h is the height.

Therefore, the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money in order to take advantage of the discount is (1/2)(b)(y) / b = (1/2)(y)

Output: 

The average weight of 10 oarsmen in a boat is increased by 1.8 kg when one of the crew, who weighs 53 kg is replaced by a new man. Therefore, the new man's weight will be increased by 1.8 kg.

To find the weight of the new man, we need to calculate the new average weight of the boat. The new average weight will be (10 + 1.8) / 10 = 1.8 kg.

To make the new average weight 100%, we need to increase the weight of the new man by 1.8 kg. Therefore, the weight of the new man will be 1.8 kg + 1.8 kg = 3 kg.

Output: 

The formula for the volume of a rectangular solid is given by the formula V = lwh, where V is the volume, l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.

We know that the volume of the rectangular solid is given by the formula V = 3 x 4 x 15 = 180 cubic units.

The formula for the volume of a sphere is given by the formula V = (4/3)πr^3, where V is the volume, π is a constant, and r is the radius of the sphere.

We know that the volume of the rectangular solid is 180 cubic units, so we can write the equation as 180 = (4/3)πr^3.

To find the radius of the sphere, we need to find the value of r that satisfies the equation.

To do this, we need to find the value of r that makes the equation true.

One way to do this is to try different values of r until we find the one that satisfies the equation.

For example, if we try r = 1, then the equation becomes 180 = (4/3)π(1)^3","Instruction: A trader sold an article at a profit of 20% for Rs.360. What is the cost price of the article? options: A)270, B)300, C)280, D)320, E)315

Output: 

**Step 1:** Calculate the area of the original piece of square cloth.

The area of a square is given by the formula A = s^2, where A is the area and s is the length of one side of the square.

Substituting the value of s into the formula, we get A = s^2 = s^2.

Output: 

The sum of 45 and -30 is 15. Therefore, the manufactured cost of each pen is Rs. 7.2.

**The answer is:** B

The total number of pens produced is 7200. So, the total cost of production is 7200 * Rs. 7.2 = Rs. 5,760,000. The total profit on all the pens is 25%. Therefore, the total cost of production is Rs. 5,760,000 * 25% = Rs. Rs. 15,000.

The total number of pens rejected is 10% of the total number of pens produced, which is 10% * 7200 = 720 pens. So, the total number of pens delivered to the wholesaler is 7200 - 720 = 6,240 pens.

The total cost of pens delivered to the wholesaler is 6,240 * Rs. 10 = Rs. Rs. 60,000.

The total cost of pens delivered to the wholesaler is Rs. 60,000 + Rs. 15,000 = Rs. Rs. 75,000.

Instruction: The average wages of a worker during a fortnight comprising of 15 consecutive working days was $90 per day.

Output: 

The average wage for the first 7 days was $87 per day, so the total wage for the first 7 days was $87 * 7 = $588.

The average wage for the last 7 days was $92 per day, so the total wage for the last 7 days was $92 * 7 = $588.

Therefore, the total wage for the fortnight was $588 + $588 = $1188.

The wage on the 8th day was $588, so the total wage for the fortnight was $1188 - $588 = $744.

Output: 

The average number of microwave ovens sold per month is given by the formula:

Average = Total number of items sold / Total number of months

In the first 10 months, the store sold a total of 10 x 42 = 420 microwave ovens. In the remaining 10 months, the store sold a total of 10 x 20 = 200 microwave ovens. Therefore, the total number of items sold in the first 10 months is 420 + 200 = 620.

The total number of months is 10 + 10 = 20.

Therefore, the average number of microwave ovens sold per month is 620 / 20 = 31.

Output: 

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = lw, where A is the area, l is the length, and w is the width.

We know that the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, and the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet. So, the length of the painted side is 37 - 9 = 28 feet.

Therefore, the area of the parking space is A = 28w.

If the area of the parking space is 126 square feet, then the width of the parking space is 126/28 = 4.5 feet.

The area of the parking space is 126 square feet, and the width of the parking space is 4.5 feet. So, the area of the parking space is 126 square feet, and the width of the parking space is 4.5 feet.

Output: 

**Explanation:**

1. The frog jumps 3m up and falls back 2m down, so the net change in depth is 3m - 2m = 1m.

2. The depth of the well is 30m, so the frog will come out of the well when the depth of the well is equal to the depth of the frog.

3. To find the number of days it will take for the frog to come out of the well, we need to find the number of days it will take for the depth of the well to reach 30m.

4. The formula for finding the number of days is:

n = log(30/y)

where n is the number of days, y is the depth of the frog, and log is the logarithm function.

**The answer is:** A) 8

The number of days it will take for the frog to come out of the well is 8.

Output: 

The formula for the monthly installment is given by the formula:

M = P * r * (1 + r)^n

where M is the monthly installment, P is the principal amount, r is the interest rate, and n is the number of months.

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:

M = 360 * 0.025 * (1 + 0.025)^12

M = Rs.36

Therefore, the interest rate is:

r = (36 - 31.50) / 360 * 100%

r = 1.5%

The average weight of 10 oarsmen in a boat is increased by 1.8 kg when one of the crew, who weighs 53 kg is replaced by a new man. Therefore, the new man's weight will be increased by 1.8 kg, which is equivalent to 54% of his original weight. To find the weight of the new man, we need to multiply his original weight by 54%.

Output: 

**Explanation:**

1. Neha is 12th from left end and Radha is 6th from right end. So, the number of children between Neha and Radha is 6.

2. When Radha is shifted to left by 2 places, the number of children between Neha and Radha becomes 6 + 2 = 8.

3. When Neha is shifted to right by 2 places, the number of children between Neha and Radha becomes 8 + 2 = 10.

Instruction: Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. If the yard has an area of 240 square meters, how many meters of fencing does she need? options: A)58, B)62, C)66, D)70, E)74
Output: 

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = lw, where A is the area, l is the length, and w is the width.

We know that the area of the yard is 240 square meters, so we can write the equation as:

240 = 10w + 2l

Solving for l, we get:

l = 240 - 10w

Substituting this into the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, we get:

P = 2l + 2w

P = 2(240 - 10w) + 2w

P = 480 - 20w + 2w

P = 480 - 18w

To find the cost of six sodas and seven bars, we need to find the value of w that maximizes the cost. This can be done by finding the value of w that maximizes the expression for the cost, which is:

C = 480 - 18w

The maximum value of C is achieved when w = 0, which means that Alice will spend the same amount of money on six sodas and seven bars as she would on two sodas and three bars.

Output: 

**Explanation:**

To find the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000, we need to find the number of integers in S that are relatively prime to 1,000.

The number of integers in S that are relatively prime to 1,000 is given by the formula:

$$n\geq 1,000\geq 1\leq n\geq 1$$

where n is the number of integers in S.

The number of integers in S that are relatively prime to 1,000 is equal to the number of integers in S that are relatively prime to 1,000 divided by the total number of integers in S.

The total number of integers in S is equal to the number of integers in S plus the number of integers in S that are multiples of 1,000.

The number of integers in S that are multiples of 1,000 is equal to the number of integers in S that are divisible by 1,000.

The number of integers in S that are divisible by 1,000 is equal to the number of integers in S that are multiples of 1,000 divided by","Instruction: Exactly 2/5th of the children in a certain class are girls.

If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item? options: A)$61, B)$65, C)$67.40, D)$70, E)$78.20
Output: 

The original price of the item is discounted 22%, which means that the customer pays 77% of the original price. Therefore, the customer paid 77% of the original price, which is 0.77 * original price.

If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price, then the original price is $1.90 less than half the original price, which is 0.5 * original price - $1.90.

Substituting this into the equation 0.77 * original price = 0.5 * original price - $1.90, we get 0.77 * original price = 0.5 * original price - $1.90.

Solving for original price, we get original price = $1.90 + 0.77 * original price.

This is a quadratic equation, and the original price is the vertex of the parabola.

The original price is $1.90 + 0.77 * original price = $1.90 + 0.77 * original price = $1.90 + 0.77 * original price = $1.90 + 0.77 * original price = $1.90 +","Instruction: On a map, the length of the road from Town F to Town G is measured to be 20 inches.

**Explanation:**

- Five dozen toys are packed in a box, which means there are 5 x 12 = 60 toys in one box.
- 98 boxes are kept in a tempo, which means there are 98 boxes in one tempo.
- To lift 29400 toys in one round, we need to find the number of toys that can be lifted in one box and the number of boxes that can lift 29400 toys in one round.
- The number of toys that can be lifted in one box is 60 x 29400 = 172800 toys.
- The number of boxes that can lift 29400 toys in one round is 98 x 172800 = 1728000 boxes.

**Step 1:** Find the age of Raj 5 years ago.

If Raj was one-third as old as Rahim 5 years back, then his age 5 years ago was one-third of his current age.

**Step 2:** Find the age of Rahim now.

If Raj is 17 years old now, then his age 5 years ago was 17 - 5 = 12 years old.

**The answer is:** B) 27

**Explanation:**

We know that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. So, if R is one-third as old as T, then the age of T must be 3 times the age of R.

Therefore, the age of T is 3 * 12 = 36 years old.

Find Mohan's share. options: A)2400, B)2500, C)2600, D)2700, E)None of these
Output: 

The formula for the area of a trapezium is given by the formula A = (b1 + b2)h/2, where A is the area, b1 and b2 are the bases, and h is the height.

Given that the area of cross-section is 640 square meters, and the depth of the canal is unknown, we can find the depth of the canal by rearranging the formula as follows:

h = A/b1

Substituting the values of A and b1 into the formula, we get:

h = 640/5100

h = 0.16

Therefore, the depth of the canal is 0.16 meters.

Output: 

Silu weighs 51 Kgs. Meenu weighs 29 Kgs.

To make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink, we need to add 0.6 * 51 = 30.6 Kgs of orange juice.

The total weight of the soft drink is 51 + 29 = 80 Kgs.

To find the additional gallons of orange juice, we need to divide the weight of the orange juice by the weight of one gallon of orange juice.

30.6 / 0.4 = 75

Therefore, Meenu must add 75 gallons of orange juice to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink.

Output: 

The formula for the time taken to travel by train is given by the formula:

Time taken by train = Distance/Speed

where Distance is the length of the rectangle and Speed is the speed of the train.

If the length of the rectangle is 27 cm and the width is 17 cm, then the area of the rectangle is:

Area of rectangle = Length x Width

Area of rectangle = 27 x 17

Area of rectangle = 441 cm^2

If the speed of the train is constant, then the time taken to travel by train is given by the formula:

Time taken by train = Distance/Speed

Time taken by train = 441/Speed

If the speed of the train is increased, then the time taken to travel by train will decrease. If the speed of the train is decreased, then the time taken to travel by train will increase.

Therefore, the time taken to travel by train will depend on the speed of the train.

If the speed of the train is increased, then the time taken to travel by train will decrease.

Output: 

**Explanation:**

1. Calculate the cost of each bag of flour.

The cost of each bag of flour is $100 - 25% of $100 = $75.

2. Calculate the number of bags sold.

The number of bags sold is $3,000 / $75 = 40 bags.

**The answer is:** D

Therefore, the minimum number of bags of flour that would be worth it to purchase the membership is 40.

**The answer is:** D

The total cost of renting DVDs with a membership is $2.00 per movie x 40 movies = $80.

The total profit from renting DVDs with a membership is $80 - $4.00 per movie x 40 movies = $320.

Therefore, the minimum number of DVDs that would be worth it to purchase the membership is 40.

**The answer is:** D

The bus fare for two persons is four-thirds of the train fare. So, the bus fare is 4/3 * train fare.

2. Find the total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus.

The total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus is 6 * bus fare.

Output: 

**Explanation:**

The total number of ways to select 2 balls from a box containing a certain number of balls, marked successively from 1 to n, is given by the formula:

$$nC2 = n! / (2!(n-2)!)$$

where n is the number of balls in the box.

If there are 45 different ways that two balls can be selected from the box such that the ball with number 3 marked on it is not selected, then the number of ways to select 2 balls from the box such that the ball with number 3 marked on it is not selected is given by the formula:

$$nC2 - 3! = 45$$

where n is the number of balls in the box.

**The answer is:** A) 11

Therefore, the number of balls in the box is 11.

**The answer is:** B) 10
