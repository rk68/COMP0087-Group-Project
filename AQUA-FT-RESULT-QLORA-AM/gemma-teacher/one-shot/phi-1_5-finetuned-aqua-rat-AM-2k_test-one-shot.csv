Instruction: All 250 files on Sam's hard drive are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm? options: A)50, B)70, C)75, D)100, E)125
Output: 
Let the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm be x.
Then, the number of files infected by only a worm is 2.5x.
The number of files infected by only a virus is 50% of the total number of files, which is 0.5(250) = 125.
The total number of files infected by both a virus and a worm is x + 2.5x = 3.5x.
The total number of files infected by only a virus is 50% of the total number of files, which is 0.5(250) = 125.
The total number of files infected by both a virus and a worm is 3.5x + 125 = 250.
Solving for x, we get x = 50.
Therefore, the number of files NOT infected by a worm is 250 - 125 = 125.

Instruction: The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost? options: A)20%, B)28%, C)36%, D)40%, E)42%
Output: 
Let the original retail price be x.
Then, the wholesale price is (x-60)/100.
The selling price is (x-20)/100.
The profit is (x-20)/100 - (x-60)/100 = 20/100 = 1/5.
So, the selling price is 1.2 times the wholesale price.
1.2x = x - 60
x = 60
So, the original retail price is 60.
The selling price is 20% less than the original retail price.
So, the selling price is 80% of the original retail price.
80% of 60 = 48
So, the selling price is 48.

Output: 
Let the smaller number be 3x.
Then the larger number is 5x.
If 9 is subtracted from each, the new numbers are (3x-9) and (5x-9).
The new numbers are in the ratio 12:23.
So, (3x-9)/(5x-9) = 12/23
3x-9 = 12(5x-9)/23
3x-9 = 60x-108
3x = 108
x = 36
So, the smaller number is 3x = 3(36) = 108.

Instruction: A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ? options: A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280
Output: 
Let's assume that the company sells the components at a price of x dollars per component.
The revenue from sales is 420x dollars.
The production cost is 110x dollars.
The yearly profit is (420x - 110x) = 280x dollars.
We want the yearly profit to be at least $626,400, so we can write the equation: 280x ≥ 626,400.
Solving for x, we get x ≥ 26,400/280 = $130.

Output: 
Let the total number of students be x.
Then, 20% of x = (20/100)*x = (1/5)*x
28% of x = (28/100)*x = (7/25)*x
Total number of students = (1/5)*x + (7/25)*x = (12/25)*x

Output: 
Let the speed of the ship be x miles per hour.
Then, the speed of the plane is 10x miles per hour.
The distance traveled by the ship is 180 miles.
The distance traveled by the plane is 10x * 180 = 1800 miles.
The distance between the ship and the plane is the total distance traveled by the ship and the plane.
So, the distance between the ship and the plane is 180 + 1800 = 2160 miles.
The distance between the ship and the plane when they meet is 2160 miles.
So, the distance when they meet is 2160 - 180 = 2000 miles.

x + (50 - x) = 83
x = 16
y = 34
Total number of students = x + y = 50 + 34 = 84
Total class average = (x * 83 + y * 55)/84 = (16 * 83 + 34 * 55)/84 = (1320 + 1710)/84 = 2950/84 = 44%

Output: 
Let the height of the room be x.
Then, the width of the room is (2x+5)/2.
The area of the room is (2x+5)(x+5) = 15.

Instruction: A jeep travels a certain distance taking 6 hours in the forward journey. During the return journey, it increased its speed by 12km/hr and took 4 hours. What is the distance travelled by the jeep? options: A)126km, B)144km, C)127km, D)228km, E)128km
Output: 
Let the distance travelled by the jeep be x km.
Then, the time taken by the jeep to travel x km in the forward journey is 6 hours.
The time taken by the jeep to travel x km in the return journey is 4 hours.
The speed of the jeep in the forward journey is 55 km/hr.
The speed of the jeep in the return journey is (55+12) km/hr = 67 km/hr.
Therefore, x = (6*55)/4 + (4*67)/4 = 127km.

Output: 
Answer: E

Explanation:
Let the monthly income be x.
Then, the monthly savings = 12 1/2% of x = (12/2)x = x/2
Total monthly expenses = 3500
Total monthly savings = x/2 - 3500
Total monthly income = x
Total monthly income = x/2 - 3500
Total monthly income = x/2 - 3500
Total monthly income = x/2 - 3500
Total monthly income = x/2 - 3500
Total monthly income = x/2 - 3500
Total monthly income = x/2 - 3500
Total monthly income = x/2 - 3500
Total monthly income = x/2 - 3500
Total monthly income = x/2 - 3500
Total monthly income = x/2 - 3500
Total monthly income = x/2 - 3500
Total monthly income = x/2 - 3500
Total monthly income = x/2 - 3500
Total monthly income = x/2 - 3500
Total monthly income = x/2 - 3500
Total monthly income = x/2 - 3500
Total monthly income = x/","Instruction: The events A and B are independent. The probability that event A occurs is 0.6, and the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. What is the probability that event B occurs? options: A)0.5, B)0.6, C)0.7, D)0.8, E)0.9

Output: 
Let the total deer population in the forest be x.
Then, the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is 20/500 = 0.04.
This is the same as the percent of deer in the forest with tags from the previous year, which is 300/x.
Since the percent of deer in the forest with tags from the previous year is 300/x, the percent of deer in the forest with tags from the second year is 0.04.
Therefore, the percent of deer in the forest with tags from the second year is 0.04.
0.04 = 0.04
0.04 = 0.04
0.04 = 0.04
0.04 = 0.04

Instruction: Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool? options: A)8, B)15, C)12, D)6, E)3
Output: 
Let the rate of hose B be x.
Then, the rate of hose A is x/2.
The rate of the two hoses working together is x + x/2 = (3x + x)/2 = 4x/2 = 2x.
The time taken to fill the pool is 2x + 3x = 5x.
The time taken by hose B alone to fill the pool is x.
Therefore, the time taken by hose B alone to fill the pool is 5x - x = 4x.
Hence, it would have taken 4x hours for hose B to fill the entire pool.

Output: 
Let the original selling price of each article be x.
Then, the new selling price of each article is (x - 15/100) = (x - 0.15x) = 0.85x
The total revenue from selling 5 articles is 5x.
The total cost of buying 5 articles is 5(x - 0.15x) = 5x - 0.75x = 4.25x
The profit is the revenue minus the cost, which is 5x - 4.25x = 0.75x
0.75x = 300
x = 400
The new selling price of each article is $40.

Instruction: Two friends are eating a jar full of candies. Had P eaten alone, it would have taken him 10 minutes to finish the candies in the jar. Had Q eaten alone, it would have taken her 5 minutes to finish half the jar. Since both of them are eating simultaneously, how many minutes would it take them to empty the jar? options: A)4, B)5, C)6, D)7, E)8
Output: 
Let the number of candies in the jar be C.
P can eat C/2 candies in 10 minutes.
Q can eat C/4 candies in 5 minutes.
When they are eating simultaneously, the number of candies eaten in 1 minute is (C/2 + C/4) candies.
Therefore, the time taken to empty the jar is C/2 + C/4 = (3C + 2C)/4 = 5C/4 minutes.

Instruction: Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time.

How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other? options: A)3 hours, B)5 hours, C)6 hours, D)4 hours, E)7 hours
Output: 
Let the time taken by the first car to be 15 miles away be x hours.
Then, the distance travelled by the first car in x hours = 55x miles.
The distance travelled by the second car in x hours = 52x miles.
The total distance travelled by both cars in x hours = 55x + 52x = 107x miles.
107x = 15
x = 15/107
x = 0.14 hours

Output: 
Let the number of staplers produced be x.
Then, the number of defective staplers produced is 10% of x = 0.1x.
The number of non-defective staplers produced is x - 0.1x = 0.9x.
The number of staplers rejected by mistake is 2% of the non-defective staplers = 0.02(0.9x) = 0.18x.
Given that 0.18x = 72, we can solve for x.
x = 72 / 0.18 = 400.

Then, the amount of money that Charles received after one year is x + 0.08x = 1.08x
The amount of money that Charles received after two years is 1.08x + 0.08(1.08x) = 1.08x + 0.116x = 1.116x
The amount of money that Charles received after three years is 1.116x + 0.116(1.116x) = 1.116x + 0.1444x = 1.1844x
The amount of money that Charles received after four years is 1.1844x + 0.1444(1.1844x) = 1.1844x + 0.2288x = 1.3264x
The amount of money that Charles received after five years is 1.3264x + 0.2288(1.3264x) = 1.3264x + 0.3382x = 1.5264x

Explanation:
Let the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period be x.
Then, the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the first 10 months is (42-20)/10 = 2.
The average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the first 10 months is (x-2)/10.
The average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the first 10 months is (2*10)/10 = 2.
The average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the first 10 months is (x-2)/10 = (x-2)/10.
The average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the first 10 months is (x-2)/10 = (x-2)/10.
The average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the first 10 months is (x-2)/10 = (x-2)/10.

Instruction: Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun.

Output: 
Let's assume that Arjun has x dollars and Sajal has y dollars.
If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, then Arjun will have (x - 30) dollars and Sajal will have (y + 30) dollars.
If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, then Arjun will have (x + 10) dollars and Sajal will have (y - 10) dollars.
According to the given information,
(x - 30) = 2(y + 30)
x - 30 = 2y + 60
x = 2y + 30
Now, we can substitute the value of x in the equation (x - 30) = 2(y + 30)
(2y + 30) - 30 = 2y + 60
y = 60
Substituting the value of y in the equation x = 2y + 30
x = 2(60) + 30
x = 120 + 30
x = 150
Therefore, Arjun has $150 and Sajal has $60.

How many times did the coin landed on Heads ? options: A)10, B)23, C)16, D)18, E)12
Output: 
Answer: C
Explanation:
Let's assume that the coin landed on Heads x times and Tails y times.
The probability of getting Heads is 1/2.
The probability of getting Tails is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.
The probability of getting Heads x times and Tails y times is (1/2)x(1/2)y.
The probability of getting Heads x times and Tails y times is (1/2)x(1/2)y = (1/2)xy.
The probability of getting Heads x times and Tails y times is (1/2)x(1/2)y = (1/2)xy.
The probability of getting Heads x times and Tails y times is (1/2)x(1/2)y = (1/2)xy.
The probability of getting Heads x times and Tails y times is (1/2)x(1/2)y = (1/2)xy.

Instruction: Of the 200 students in a school, at least 45% attended the prom night and at least 35% took part in the debating session. What is the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session? options: A)27, B)81, C)90, D)99, E)110
Output: 
Let the number of students who attended the prom night be x.
Then, the number of students who took part in the debating session is (200 - x).

Now, we know that at least 45% of the students attended the prom night and at least 35% took part in the debating session.

So, (45/100)x + (35/100)(200 - x) ≥ (45/100)(200) + (35/100)(200 - x)

Simplifying the above equation, we get:

x ≥ (45/100)(200 - x) + (35/100)(200 - x)

x ≥ (45/100)(200 - x) + (35/100)(200 - x)

x ≥ (45/100)(200 - x) + (35/100)(200 - x)

x ≥ (45/100)(200 - x) + (35/100)(200 - x)

x ≥ (45/100)(200 - x) + (35/100)(200 - x)

x ≥ (45/100)(200 - x) + (35/100)(200 -","Instruction: Assistants are needed to prepare for preparation. Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes/hr.

If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item? options: A)$61, B)$65, C)$67.40, D)$70, E)$78.20
Output: 
Let the original price of the item be x.
The discounted price of the item is 22% less than the original price, so the discounted price is (100-22)/100*x = 78/100*x
The customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price, so the customer paid (1.90+0.5*x)/2*x = 78/2*x = 78/x
The customer paid $20 off the original price, so the customer paid 78/x - 20 = 78/x
The customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price, so the customer paid 78/x + 1.90 = 78/x + 1.90 = 78/x + 0.90 = 78/x + 0.90 = 78/x + 0.90 = 78/x
The customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price, so the customer paid 78/x + 0.90 = 78/x + 0.90 = 78/x + 0.90 = 78/x + 0.90 = 78/x + 0.90 = 78/x + 0.90 = 78/x + 0.90 =","Instruction: On a map, the length of the road from Town F to Town G is measured to be 20 inches.

Output: 
Let x be the number of bags of flour sold.
Then, the selling price of each bag of flour is 100 + 25% of 100 = 125.
The total revenue from selling x bags of flour is 125x.
The total profit is the revenue minus the cost, which is 125x - (100x + 3000) = 125x - 100x - 3000 = 25x - 3000.
We know that 25x - 3000 = $3,000.

Output: 
Let the distance between the starting point and the starting point of ball A be d.
Then, the distance between the starting point and the starting point of ball B is d + d/5 = d + d/2 = d + d = 2d.
The time taken by ball A to complete one full rotation is 26 minutes.
The time taken by ball B to complete one full rotation is 35 minutes.
The time taken by ball A to complete 2 full rotations is 2d * 26 = 52d.
The time taken by ball B to complete 2 full rotations is 2d * 35 = 70d.
The total time taken by ball A to complete 2 full rotations is 52d + 70d = 122d.
The total time taken by ball B to complete 2 full rotations is 70d + 2d = 72d.
The total time taken by both balls to complete 2 full rotations is 122d + 72d = 184d.
The total time taken by both balls to complete 2 full rotations is 2d * 26 = 52d.
The total time taken by both balls to complete 2 full rotations is 2d * 35 = 70d.
