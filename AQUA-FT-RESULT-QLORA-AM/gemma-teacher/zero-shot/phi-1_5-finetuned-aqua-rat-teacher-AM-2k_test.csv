Output: 

**Explanation:**

The area of a square is given by the formula A = s^2, where s is the length of its side.

If the side of the square is 20 cm, then its area is A = 20^2 = 400 cm^2.

If two semi circles are drawn on the opposite sides of the square, then their combined area is A = 2(πr^2) = 2(π(20/2)^2) = 2(π(10)^2) = 2(100π) = 200π cm^2.

Therefore, the area of the remaining paper is A = 400 - 200π = 200π cm^2.

**Answer:**

The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?

To find the answer, we need to first calculate the original retail price of the appliance. We know that the original retail price was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost, so we can calculate the original retail price by adding 60 percent to the wholesale cost.

Once we have the original retail price, we can find the percentage increase by subtracting 20 percent from the original retail price and dividing by the original retail price.

What will be the measure of each side? options: A)9, B)11, C)22, D)25, E)31
Output: 

**Explanation:**

The area of the rectangle is given by the formula A = l * b, where A is the area, l is the length, and b is the breadth.

The area of the square is given by the formula A = s^2, where A is the area, s is the length of each side.

Since the area of the rectangle is equal to the area of the square, we can write the equation as:

27 * 17 = s^2

Solving for s, we get:

s = √(27 * 17) = √(4 * 4 * 17) = √(17 * 17) = √(17 * 17) = 17

Output: 

[5 +? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6

**Explanation:**

The given equation is:

(5 +? × 19 - 15 - 7) / (13 × 13 - 156) = 6

To find the value of?, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.

**Step 1:**

Multiply both sides of the equation by 13 to get rid of the denominator:

(5 +? × 19 - 15 - 7) = 13 × 13 - 156

**Step 2:**

Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:

(5 +? × 19 - 15 - 7) - 5 = 13 × 13 - 156 - 5

**Step 3:**

Divide both sides of the equation by 13:

(5 +? × 19 - 15 - 7) / 13 = 13 × 13 - 156 - 5 / 13

**Step 4:**

Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:

How many members does the group have now, if the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3? options: A)277, B)288, C)200, D)277, E)168
Output: 

**Explanation:**

1. Calculate the total number of boys and girls in the group.

Total number of boys = 64
Total number of girls = 40

2. Calculate the ratio of boys to girls.

Ratio of boys to girls = 4:3

3. Calculate the number of boys and girls that joined the group.

Number of boys that joined = Total number of boys / 4 = 64 / 4 = 16
Number of girls that joined = Total number of girls / 3 = 40 / 3 = 13.33

4. Calculate the total number of members in the group.

Total number of members = Number of boys that joined + Number of girls that joined = 16 + 13.33 = 29.33

**The answer is:** B) 288

The group has a total of 288 members now.

**Note:** The answer is 288, not 277. This is because the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, which means that for every 4 boys, there are 3 girls. Therefore, if the same number of boys and girls join the group, the ratio of boys to girls"

Output: 

**Explanation:**

The company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost of $110 per component. Therefore, the total cost of producing 420 units of the component is 420 x $110 = $54,600.

The company sells all of the components by the end of each month, so the total revenue from sales is 420 x $110 = $54,600.

The minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 is $54,600 + $626,400 = $1,066,400.

**The answer is:** B) 230

The cost per unit is $110, so the total cost of producing 420 units of the component is 420 x $110 = $54,600.

The total revenue from sales is 420 x $110 = $54,600.

Output: 

**Explanation:**

The speed of the ship is 180 miles per hour. The speed of the plane is 10 times the speed of the ship, which is 10 * 180 = 1800 miles per hour.

The time taken by the ship to travel 180 miles is 180/180 = 1 hour.

The time taken by the plane to travel the same distance is 200/1800 = 0.1111 hours.

The distance traveled by the ship is 180 miles.

The distance traveled by the plane is 200 miles.

The time taken by the ship and the plane to meet is 1 + 0.1111 = 1.1111 hours.

The distance traveled by the ship and the plane to meet is 180 + 200 = 380 miles.

The distance traveled by the ship is 200 miles.

The time taken by the ship to travel the same distance is 200/200 = 1 hour.

The time taken by the plane to travel the same distance is 200/1800 = 0.1111 hours.

The distance traveled by the ship and the plane to meet is 200 + 380 = 580 miles.

Ram meets Krishna at point C on the road after 10 seconds. Find the total distance between A to B. options: A)700 meters, B)1000 meters, C)700 kilometers, D)555 meters, E)600 meters
Output: 

**Explanation:**

The distance traveled by Ram and Krishna is given by the formula:

$$d = \frac{s}{t}$$

where d is the distance traveled, s is the speed of travel, and t is the time taken.

For Ram, the distance traveled is:

$$d_r = 20t$$

For Krishna, the distance traveled is:

$$d_k = 40t$$

The total distance traveled by both of them is:

$$d_total = d_r + d_k$$

Substituting the values of d_r and d_k into the formula, we get:

$$d_total = 20t + 40t = 60t$$

Given that the time taken is 10 seconds, we can find the total distance traveled by:

$$d_total = 60t = 60t = 600 meters$$

Therefore, the total distance between A to B is 600 meters.

**The answer is:** B) 1000 meters

The answer is B) 1000 meters because the distance traveled by Krishna is greater than the distance traveled by"

To find the monthly sales, we need to first calculate the 5% of all monthly sales.

5% of all monthly sales = 0.05 * S

The monthly sales should be $50000 + 0.05 * S = $1500

S = $1500 - $50000

S = $20000

**The answer is:** B) $40000

The monthly sales should be $40000 to reach a monthly salary of $1500.

**The answer is:** B) $40000

The monthly sales should be $40000 to reach a monthly salary of $1500.

**The answer is:** B) $40000

The monthly sales should be $40000 to reach a monthly salary of $1500.

**The answer is:** B) $40000

The monthly sales should be $40000 to reach a monthly salary of $1500.

of 55. If the overall class average was 76, what percent of the class passed? options: A)44%, B)66%, C)68%, D)72%, E)75%
Output: 

**Explanation:**

The passing students had an average of 83, while the failing students had an average of 55. Therefore, the total number of passing students is 83 * number of passing students.

The total number of students is therefore 83 * number of passing students + number of failing students.

The overall class average is 76, so the total number of students is 76 * number of students.

Therefore, the number of passing students is 83 * number of students.

The number of passing students is therefore 83 * number of students / number of students.

The number of passing students is therefore 83 * number of students / number of students * number of students.

The number of passing students is therefore 83 * number of students / number of students * number of students * number of students.

The number of passing students is therefore 83 * number of students / number of students * number of students * number of students.

The number of passing students is therefore 83 * number of students / number of students * number of students * number of students.

The number of passing students is therefore 83 * number of students / number of students * number of students *"

Output: 

**Explanation:**

The hollow cube has a volume of 5cm^3 and a thickness of 1cm. The volume of a cube is given by the formula V = s^3, where V is the volume, s is the length of the side, and ^ is the exponent.

Therefore, the volume of the cube is 5^3 = 125cm^3.

The volume of the smaller cubes is given by the formula V = s^3, where V is the volume, s is the length of the side, and ^ is the exponent.

Therefore, the volume of the smaller cubes is 125^3 = 125000cm^3.

The number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is given by the formula n = V/s^3, where n is the number of faces, V is the volume, and s is the length of the side.

Therefore, the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is 125000/1^3 = 125000 faces.

**The answer is:** B) 550

The total number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is 550.

What is the perimeter of the piece? options: A)60 m, B)61 m, C)62 m, D)63 m, E)64 m
Output: 

**Explanation:**

The length of the rectangular piece is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth. So, the length is 4 times the breadth + 1.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:

Perimeter = 2(length + breadth)

Substituting the values of length and breadth into the formula, we get:

Perimeter = 2(4(breadth) + 1 + breadth)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

Perimeter = 2(4(breadth) + 4(breadth) + 1)

Perimeter = 2(4(breadth) + 4(breadth) + 4(breadth))

Perimeter = 2(4(breadth) + 4(breadth) + 4(breadth))

Perimeter = 2(4(breadth) + 4(breadth) + 4(breadth))

Perimeter = 2(4(breadth) + 4(breadth) + 4(breadth))

Perimeter = 2(4(breadth) + 4(breadth) + 4(breadth"

Output: 

**Explanation:**

The speed of the jeep during the forward journey is given by the formula:

Speed = Distance/Time

Therefore, the distance travelled by the jeep during the forward journey is:

Speed = Distance/6

Substituting the value of speed into the formula, we get:

Distance = Speed x Time

Distance = 126km/6

Distance = 21km

The speed of the jeep during the return journey is given by the formula:

Speed = Distance/Time

Therefore, the distance travelled by the jeep during the return journey is:

Speed = Distance/4

Substituting the value of speed into the formula, we get:

Distance = Speed x Time

Distance = 12km/4

Distance = 3km

The total distance travelled by the jeep is:

Total Distance = Distance travelled during forward journey + Distance travelled during return journey

Total Distance = 21km + 3km
