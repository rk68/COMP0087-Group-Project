Output: 

The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?

The answer is:

The answer is B) 28%.

Explanation:

To find the original retail price of an appliance, we need to add 60 percent of its wholesale cost to its wholesale cost. To find the discounted price, we need to subtract 20 percent of the original retail price from the original retail price.

The discounted price is the original retail price minus the discounted price.

The discounted price is 60 percent of the wholesale cost minus 20 percent of the original retail price.

The discounted price is 60 percent of the wholesale cost minus 20 percent of the original retail price.

The discounted price is 60 percent of the wholesale cost minus 20 percent of the original retail price.

The discounted price is 60 percent of the wholesale cost minus 20 percent of the original retail price.

The discounted price is 60 percent of the wholesale cost minus 20 percent of the original retail price.

Output: 

The average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers is equal to x.

The formula for the average score is given by the formula:

Average score = (Sum of all scores) / (Number of students)

If the average score for the entire class is equal to y and there are z students in the class, then the sum of all scores is equal to yz.

Therefore, the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers is equal to yz - 2x.

The answer is: B

The explanation:

To find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers, we need to first find the sum of all scores. This is given by the formula:

Sum of all scores = yz

Next, we need to find the number of students in the class. This is given by the formula:

Number of students = z

Finally, we can find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers by subtracting the sum of all scores from the average score. This is given by the formula:

Output: 

**Explanation:**

The monthly salary of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales.

To find the monthly sales, we need to solve the equation:

500 + 0.05S = 1500

where S is the monthly sales.

We can solve for S by subtracting 500 from both sides of the equation:

0.05S = 1000

Then, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.05:

S = $20,000

Therefore, the monthly sales should be $20,000 to reach a monthly salary of $1500.
