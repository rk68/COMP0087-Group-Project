cents. If the costs of the items do not change, compute the cost in cents of six sodas and seven bars. options: A)500, B)600, C)750, D)800, E)900
Output: 
Let the cost of one soda be x cents.
Then the cost of two sodas is 2x cents.
Let the cost of one energy bar be y cents.
Then the cost of two energy bars is 2y cents.
Then the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars is 6x + 7y cents.
We know that 6x + 7y = 600 cents.
Solving for x and y, we get x = 150 cents and y = 300 cents.
Therefore, the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars is 6(150) + 7(300) = 900 cents.

The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm? options: A)50, B)70, C)75, D)100, E)125
Output: 
Let the number of files infected by a virus be x.
Then the number of files infected by a worm is 2.5x.
The total number of files is 250, so we have:
x + 2.5x = 250
3.5x = 250
x = 71.43
Since the number of files infected by a virus must be a whole number, we can round up to 72.
The number of files infected by both a virus and a worm is 2.5x, so we have:
2.5x = 2.5(72) = 180
The number of files infected by only a worm is 2.5x, so we have:
2.5x = 2.5(72) = 180
The number of files infected by only a virus is 50% of the total, so we have:
50% of 250 = 0.5(250) = 125
The number of files infected by only a worm is 2.5x, so we have:
2.5x = 2.5(125) = 375
The number of files infected by both a virus and a worm is 180, so we have:

How many sales of $250 each must he make in order to reach a salary of at least $1000? options: A)15, B)24, C)25, D)40, E)52
Output: 
Let x be the number of sales of $250 each.
Then, the total commission earned is 10% of x, which is 0.1x.
The total salary is $1000.
So, we have the equation:

If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost? options: A)20%, B)28%, C)36%, D)40%, E)42%
Output: 
Let the wholesale cost of the appliance be x.
Then, the retail price of the appliance is (1+60/100)*x = (1.6*x)
Let the selling price of the appliance be (1-20/100)*(1.6*x) = (0.8*x)
(0.8*x) = (1.6*x)
x = (1.6*x)/0.8 = 2*x
The selling price of the appliance is (1.6*x)/0.8 = 2*x
The selling price of the appliance is (2*x)/0.8 = 2*x
The selling price of the appliance is (2*x)/0.8 = 2*x

Output: 
Let the speed of the current be x kmph.
Then, the speed of the man is 4 - x kmph.
The time taken by the man to row the distance is t1.
The time taken by the man to row the distance against the current is t2.
The distance covered by the man is d.
The distance covered by the man against the current is d - x.
The time taken by the man to row the distance against the current is t2 = d - x.
The time taken by the man to row the distance against the current is t1 = d/4.
The distance covered by the man against the current is d - x = d/4 - x.
The distance covered by the man along the current is d - x = d/4.
The time taken by the man to row the distance along the current is t1 = d/4.
The time taken by the man to row the distance along the current is t2 = d/4.
The distance covered by the man along the current is d - x = d/4 - x = d/4.

How many hours will she take to cover 100 km options: A)9 hours., B)10 hours., C)11 hours., D)12 hours., E)13 hours.
Output: 
1.5 hours = 10 km/h * 10 min = 10/60 = 1/6 hours
100 km = 100/1.5 = 66.67 km/h
66.67 km/h = 66.67 km/h * 1.5 hours = 100 km
Answer: E.
Explanation:
1.5 hours = 10 km/h * 10 min = 10/60 = 1/6 hours
100 km = 100/1.5 = 66.67 km/h
66.67 km/h = 66.67 km/h * 1.5 hours = 100 km
Answer: E.
Explanation:
1.5 hours = 10 km/h * 10 min = 10/60 = 1/6 hours
100 km = 100/1.5 = 66.67 km/h
66.67 km/h = 66.67 km/h * 1.5 hours = 100 km
Answer: E.
Explanation:
1.5 hours = 10 km/h * 10 min = 10/60 = 1/6 hours
100 km = 100/1.5 = 66.67 km/h

Let x be the number of helpers required.
Then, the number of large cakes made by x helpers is 2x.
The number of small cakes made by x helpers is 35x.
The total number of cakes made by x helpers is 2x + 35x = 37x.
The total number of cakes needed is 2x + 35x = 37x.

Output: 
Let the original price of the tubeless tyres be x.
Then, the discounted price of the tubeless tyres is (x - 0.2x) = 0.8x.
Let the original price of the non-tubeless tyres be y.
Then, the discounted price of the non-tubeless tyres is (y - 0.2y) = 0.8y.
The total discount available at the retailer is (0.8x + 0.8y) = 1.6x.
Answer: E
Explanation:
The total discount available at the retailer is (0.8x + 0.8y) = 1.6x.
Answer: E
Explanation:
The total discount available at the retailer is (0.8x + 0.8y) = 1.6x.

Output: 
Saving = 25% of cover price = 25/100 * cover price = (25/100) * cover price = (1/4) * cover price
15 * (1/4) * cover price = $42.00
cover price = $42.00 * 4 = $168.00
Answer: D. $4.73
Explanation:
Saving = 25% of cover price = 25/100 * cover price = (1/4) * cover price
15 * (1/4) * cover price = $42.00
cover price = $42.00 * 4 = $168.00
Answer: D. $4.73
Explanation:
Saving = 25% of cover price = 25/100 * cover price = (1/4) * cover price

Output: 
Let the height of the room be x.
Then, the length of the room is (5x)/2.
The area of the room is (5x)/2 * x = 15 sq.m.
The cost of paper is (2x * 50) = 100x.
The cost of paper for the walls is (100x * 2) = 200x.
