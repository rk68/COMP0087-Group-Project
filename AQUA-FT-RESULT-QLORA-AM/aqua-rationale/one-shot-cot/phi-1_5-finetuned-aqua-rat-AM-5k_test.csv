Output: 
Let the number of distinct bike no's be x.
Then, the number of distinct letters in the bike no's is 2x.
The number of distinct bike no's followed by 2 no's is 2x + 2.
2x + 2 = 2(2x + 2)
2x + 2 = 4x + 4
2x - 4x = 4 - 2
-2x = 2
x = -1
The number of distinct letters in the bike no's followed by 2 no's is 2x + 2 = 2(-1) + 2 = -2 + 2 = -1.
The number of distinct bike no's followed by 2 no's is 2x + 2 = 2(-1) + 2 = -2 + 2 = -1.
The number of distinct bike no's followed by 2 no's is 2x + 2 = 2(-1) + 2 = -2 + 2 = -1.
The number of distinct bike no's followed by 2 no's is 2x + 2 = 2(-1) + 2 = -2 + 2 = -1.
The number of distinct bike no's followed by 2 no's is 2x + 2 = 2(-1) + 2 = -2 + 2 = -1.

During 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, of which only 20 had tags from the previous year. If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)? options: A)300, B)500, C)5000, D)6000, E)7500
Output: Let N = the total number of deer in the forest.
During the first year, the percent of deer in the entire population with tags was: 300/N
20/500 is the percent of deer caught during the second year that had tags. Since this sample percent matches the percent for the entire population (i.e., the total number of tagged deer divided by the total number of deer), the two ratios are equal.
Equating these two percents:
Sample = Population
(20/500)=(300/N)
N = (300/1)*(500/20)
N=7500

Instruction: A coin made of alloy of aluminum and silver measures 2 x 15 mm (it is 2 mm thick and its diameter is 15 mm). If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum? options: A)36 grams, B)40 grams, C)42 grams, D)48 grams, E)50 grams
Output: 
Let the weight of pure aluminum in the coin be x grams.
Then, the weight of the alloy is (2x + 15) grams.
The volume of the alloy is (2x + 15)/2 = x/2 cubic mm.
The weight of the coin is 30 grams.
The volume of the coin is 30/x cubic mm.
The volume of the coin is equal to the volume of the alloy.
30/x = (2x + 15)/2
2x + 15 = 2x
x = 15
The weight of the coin is (2x + 15) = (2*15 + 15) = 45 grams.
The weight of the pure aluminum is 15 grams.
The weight of the alloy is 45 - 15 = 30 grams.

If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm? options: A)50, B)70, C)75, D)100, E)125
Output: 
Let the number of files infected by a virus be x.
Then, the number of files infected by a worm is 2.5x.
The number of files infected by both a virus and a worm is 2.5x + x = 3.5x.
If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, then 0.5x = 50.
Solving for x, we get x = 100.
The number of files NOT infected by a worm is 3.5x - 2.5x = 1.5x = 75.

Ball B makes 5 full rotation in 35 minutes.

Output: If ball A makes 2 rotations in 26 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 13 minutes. If ball B makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 7 minutes.
The two balls start rotating now and makes several rotations before they are at the SAME starting points. Ball A would have done a WHOLE number X of rotations and ball B would have done a WHOLE number Y of rotations. Also they would have rotated during the same period of time T. Hence
T = 13 X = 7 Y
Hence 13 X = 7 Y
Solve the above for X
X = 7 Y / 13
We want the time when they are FIRST at the same starting point. Therefore X and Y are the smallest whole numbers of the equation X = 7 Y / 13. The smallest value of Y that gives X as a whole number is 13. Hence
X = 7 (13) / 13 = 7
Time T is given by
T = 13 X = 13 * 7 = 91 minutes = 1 hour and 31 minutes

Output: 
Let the numbers be 3x and 5x.
Then, 3x - 9 = 12x - 9
3x - 12x = 9 - 9
-9x = 0
x = 0
The smaller number is 3x = 0.

Instruction: A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ? options: A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280
Output: 
Let's assume that the selling price of each component is x.
The total revenue from selling 420 units of each component is 420x.
The total production cost is 420x.
The minimum selling price that will guarantee a profit of at least $626,400 is 420x + 420x = 626,400.
420x + 420x = 626,400
840x = 626,400
x = 626,400/840 = 230.

Output: 
Let the amount received by each nephew be x.
Then, amount received by each daughter = 4x
Amount received by each son = 5x
Total amount received by each nephew = 4x
Total amount received by each daughter = 4x
Total amount received by each son = 5x
Total amount received by each nephew and daughter = 4x + 4x + 5x = 9x
Total amount received by each son and nephew = 5x + 9x = 14x
Total amount received by each nephew and daughter = 9x + 14x = 23x
Total amount received by each son and nephew = 5x + 23x = 28x
Total amount received by each nephew and daughter = 23x + 28x = 51x
Total amount received by each son and nephew = 14x + 28x = 42x
Total amount received by each nephew and daughter = 51x + 42x = 103x
Total amount received by each son and nephew = 5x + 42x = 47x
Total amount received by each nephew and daughter = 23x + 28x = 51x
Total amount received by each son and nephew = 14x + 28x = 42x
Total amount received by each nephew and daughter = 51x + 42x = 103x

Instruction: Calculate the percentage gain of a merchant who purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450 and sold the whole lot at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg. options: A)50 %, B)60 %, C)55 %, D)70 %, E)58%
Output: 
Let C be the cost price of 1 kg of oranges.
Then, 90 kg of oranges cost Rs. 450.
So, 90 kg of oranges cost Rs. 450/90 = Rs. 5.
So, the cost price of 1 kg of oranges = Rs. 5/90 = Rs. 0.05
Now, the selling price of 1 kg of oranges = Rs. 7.50
So, the selling price of 1 kg of oranges = Rs. 7.50/1 = Rs. 7.50
Percentage gain = (selling price - cost price)/cost price * 100
= (7.50 - 0.05)/0.05 * 100
= 750/0.05 * 100
= 15000/0.05
= 200000
Percentage gain = 200000/90

Let the total number of students be x.
8% of x = 8/100 x
4/5 of x = 4/5 x
10% of x = 10/100 x
20% of x = 20/100 x
Remaining students = 100 - (8/100 x + 4/5 x + 10/100 x)

= 1.44 * x = 1.44 * x
= 1.44 * x = 1.44 * x
= 1.44 * x = 1.44 * x
= 1.44 * x = 1.44 * x

","Instruction: What will be the cost of gardening 1-metre – broad boundary around a rectangular plot having perimeter of 340 metres at the rate of 10 per square metre? options: A)3400, B)1700, C)3440, D)Cannot be determined, E)None of these
Output: Let l and b be the length and breadth of rectangular plot respectively.
∴ According to the question,we have
2(l + b) = 340 ⇒ l + b = 170
Now, (l + 2) and (b + 2) be the length and breadth of plot with boundary.
∴ Required area = (l + 2) (b + 2) – lb
= lb + 2l + 2b + 4 – lb
= 2(l + b) + 4 = 344
∴ Required cost = 344 × 10 = 3440
