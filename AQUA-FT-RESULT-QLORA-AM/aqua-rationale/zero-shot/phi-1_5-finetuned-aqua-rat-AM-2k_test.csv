cents. If the costs of the items do not change, compute the cost in cents of six sodas and seven bars.","['A)500', 'B)600', 'C)750', 'D)800', 'E)900']",E,"Instruction: You can purchase one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents, or two sodas and three energy bars for 300
cents. If the costs of the items do not change, compute the cost in cents of six sodas and seven bars. options: A)500, B)600, C)750, D)800, E)900
Output: 
Let the cost of one soda be x cents and the cost of one energy bar be y cents.
Then,
x + 2y = 150
2x + 3y = 300
Solving these equations, we get x = 50 cents and y = 75 cents.
The cost of six sodas and seven bars is 6(50) + 7(75) = 900 cents.

Output: 
Let the number of files infected by a virus be x.
Then the number of files infected by a worm is 2.5x.
The number of files infected by both a virus and a worm is (250-x-2.5x)/2 = 125-x.
50% of the files were not infected by a virus, so the number of files infected by a virus is (250-x-125)/2 = 125-x.
The number of files infected by a worm is 2.5x.
The number of files infected by both a virus and a worm is 125-x.
The number of files infected by both a virus and a worm is (250-x-125)/2 = 125-x.

What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ? options: A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280
Output: 
Let's assume that the minimum selling price per component is x.
The total revenue from selling 420 units of the component is 420x.
The total production cost is 110x.
The yearly profit is (420x - 110x) = 280x.
We want the yearly profit to be at least $626,400, so we can write the equation 280x ≥ 626,400.
Solving for x, we get x ≥ $26,400/280 = $130.
Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit will be at least $626,400 is $130.
Answer: C.
Explanation:
Minimum selling price per component = $130
Total revenue from selling 420 units of the component = 420x
Total production cost = 110x
Yearly profit = 280x
Minimum yearly profit = $626,400
$626,400 ≥ 280x + 110x
$626,400 ≥ 390x
x ≥ $26,400/390 = $130
Answer: C.
Explanation:
Minimum selling price per component = $130
Total revenue from selling 420 units of the component = 420x

How much does each daughter receive ? options: A)Rs 400, B)Rs 500, C)Rs 600, D)Rs 700, E)Rs 800
Output: 
Let the amount of money each nephew receives be x.
Then, the amount of money each nephew receives is 4x.
Let the amount of money each daughter receives be y.
Then, the amount of money each daughter receives is 4y.
Let the amount of money each son receives be z.
Then, the amount of money each son receives is 5z.
The total amount of money is Rs 8600.
So, x + 4x + 4y + 5z + 5z = Rs 8600

Output: 
Let the number of passing students be x and the number of failing students be y.
Then, x + y = n
x + (n-y) = (n*76)/83
x + n - y = (n*76)/83
x = (n*76)/83 - n - y
x = (n*76)/83 - (n-y)
x = (n*76)/83 - (n+y)
x = (n*76)/83 - (n+y)/83
x = (n*76)/83 - (n+y)/83
x = (n*76)/83 - (n+y)/83
x = (n*76)/83 - (n+y)/83
x = (n*76)/83 - (n+y)/83

Output: 
Let the original price of the tubeless tyres be x.
Then, the discounted price of the tubeless tyres is (x - 20/100x) = (80/100x) = (8/5x)
Let the original price of the non-tubeless tyres be y.
Then, the discounted price of the non-tubeless tyres is (y - 20/100y) = (80/100y) = (8/5y)
The total discount available at the retailer is (8/5x - 8/5y) = (8/5x - 8/5y) = (8/5x - 8/5y) = (8/5x - 8/5y) = (8/5x - 8/5y) = (8/5x - 8/5y) = (8/5x - 8/5y) = (8/5x - 8/5y) = (8/5x - 8/5y) = (8/5x - 8/5y) = (8/5x - 8/5y) = (8/5x - 8/5y)"

Explanation:
Total number of books = 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 25
Number of ways to arrange 5 books = 25C5 = 25! / (5! x 5!) = 25 x 24 x 23 x 22 x 21 = 5,120
Answer: C. 920
Explanation:
Total number of books = 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 25
Number of ways to arrange 5 books = 25C5 = 25! / (5! x 5!) = 25 x 24 x 23 x 22 x 21 = 5,120
Answer: C. Cannot be determined
Explanation:
Total number of books = 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 25

Output: 
Saving = 25% of cover price = 25/100 * cover price = (25/100) * cover price = (1/4) * cover price
15 * (1/4) * cover price = $42.00
cover price = $42.00 * 4 = $168.00
Answer: D. $4.73
Explanation:
Saving = 25% of cover price = 25/100 * cover price = (1/4) * cover price
15 * (1/4) * cover price = $42.00
cover price = $42.00 * 4 = $168.00
Answer: D. $4.73
Explanation:
Saving = 25% of cover price = 25/100 * cover price = (1/4) * cover price
15 * (1/4) * cover price = $42.00

Output: 
Let the number of minutes be x.
Then, the number of yo-yos produced by machine A in x minutes is (x/6).
The number of yo-yos produced by machine B in x minutes is (x/9).
The total number of yo-yos produced in x minutes is (x/6) + (x/9) = (3x + 2x)/18 = 5x/18.

"A jeep travels a certain distance taking 6 hours in the forward journey. During the return journey, it increased its speed by 12km/hr and took 4 hours. What is the distance travelled by the jeep?","['A)126km', 'B)144km', 'C)127km', 'D)228km', 'E)128km']",B,"Instruction: A jeep travels a certain distance taking 6 hours in the forward journey. During the return journey, it increased its speed by 12km/hr and took 4 hours. What is the distance travelled by the jeep? options: A)126km, B)144km, C)127km, D)228km, E)128km
Output: 
Let the distance travelled by the jeep be x km.
Speed of the jeep in the forward journey = x/6 km/hr
Speed of the jeep in the return journey = (x+12)/4 km/hr
Distance travelled by the jeep = x/6 + (x+12)/4 = x/2 + 3x/2 = x + 3x = 4x

What is the final concentration of tea John drinks? options: A)15.38%, B)42%, C)39.86%, D)22.35%, E)32.51%
Output: 
Let the concentration of milk tea be x.
Then, the concentration of tea is (100-15-10)/100 = 85/100
(85/100)x = (85/100)(x+15+10)
85x = (85x+15+10)(100)
