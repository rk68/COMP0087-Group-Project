"You can purchase one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents, or two sodas and three energy bars for 300
cents. If the costs of the items do not change, compute the cost in cents of six sodas and seven bars.","['A)500', 'B)600', 'C)750', 'D)800', 'E)900']",E,"Instruction: You can purchase one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents, or two sodas and three energy bars for 300
cents. If the costs of the items do not change, compute the cost in cents of six sodas and seven bars. options: A)500, B)600, C)750, D)800, E)900
Output: 
Let the cost of one soda be x cents and the cost of one energy bar be y cents.
Then,
x + 2y = 150
x + 3y = 300
Solving these equations, we get x = 50 cents and y = 75 cents.
The cost of six sodas and seven bars is 6x + 7y = 600 cents.

If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum? options: A)36 grams, B)40 grams, C)42 grams, D)48 grams, E)50 grams
Output: 
Let the weight of the coin be x grams.
Then, the volume of aluminum in the alloy is (2x/15) x 15 = 2x/75 mm^3
Let the weight of the coin be y grams.
Then, the volume of silver in the alloy is (y/30) x 15 = y/450 mm^3
Since the volume of aluminum in the alloy is twice that of silver, we have:
2x/75 = y/450
Solving for y, we get:
y = (2x/75) x 450 = 2x x 30 = 60x
The weight of the coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum is 60x grams.
Answer: E.
Explanation:
Let the weight of the coin be x grams.
Then, the volume of aluminum in the alloy is (2x/15) x 15 = 2x/75 mm^3

If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm?","['A)50', 'B)70', 'C)75', 'D)100', 'E)125']",C,"Instruction: All 250 files on Sam's hard drive are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm? options: A)50, B)70, C)75, D)100, E)125
Output: 
Let the number of files infected by a virus be x.
Then the number of files infected by a worm is 2.5x.
The total number of files is 250, so x + 2.5x = 250.
Solving for x, we get x = 50.
Therefore, the number of files infected by a worm is 2.5 x 50 = 125.
The number of files NOT infected by a worm is 250 - 125 = 125.

And, the length of line segment ST is (x+22)/2.
Then, the length of line segment RU is (x+5+17+22)/2 = (x+42)/2.

Output: 
Let the rate of interest be x
Then, the amount borrowed is 5000 + x*3 = 5000 + 3x
After 3 years, the amount is 5000 + 3x*3 = 5000 + 9x
So, 5000 + 9x = 5000 + 300

How much does each daughter receive ? options: A)Rs 400, B)Rs 500, C)Rs 600, D)Rs 700, E)Rs 800
Output: 
Let the amount of money each nephew receives be x.
Then, the amount of money each nephew receives is 4x.
Let the amount of money each daughter receives be y.
Then, the amount of money each daughter receives is 4y.
Let the amount of money each son receives be z.
Then, the amount of money each son receives is 5z.
The total amount of money is Rs 8600.
So, x + 4x + 4y + 5z + 5z = Rs 8600
10x + 9y = Rs 8600
10x + 9y = Rs 8600
10x + 9y = Rs 8600
10x + 9y = Rs 8600
10x + 9y = Rs 8600
10x + 9y = Rs 8600
10x + 9y = Rs 8600
10x + 9y = Rs 8600
10x + 9y = Rs 8600
10x + 9y = Rs 8600
10x + 9y = Rs 8600
10x + 9y = Rs 8600
10x + 9y = Rs 8600
10x + 9y = Rs 8600

Output: 
Let the distance between Mumbai Central and Lucknow be d km.
Then, time taken by train A to cover the distance is d/40 hours.
Time taken by train B to cover the distance is d/72 hours.
The time taken by both trains to cover the distance is d/40 + d/72 = d/72 + 2d/72 = 3d/72 = 1/24 hours.
Hence, the time taken by train A to cover the distance is d/24 hours.
Hence, the time taken by train B to cover the distance is 2d/24 = d/12 hours.
Hence, the time when the two trains meet each other is d/12 + 2d/24 = d/24 + 1d/24 = 2d/24 = 1/24 hours.

If a retailer offers an additional 20% discount, then what is the total discount available at that retailer? options: A)10%, B)25%, C)28%, D)30%, E)36%
Output: 
Let the original price of the tubeless tyres be x.
Then, the discounted price of the tubeless tyres is (100-20)x = 80x.
Let the original price of the non-tubeless tyres be y.
Then, the discounted price of the non-tubeless tyres is (100-30)y = 70y.
The total discount available at the retailer is (80x+70y)

Output: 
Saving = 25% of cover price = 25/100 * cover price = (25/100) * cover price = (1/4) * cover price
15 * (1/4) * cover price = $42.00
cover price = $42.00 * 4 = $168.00
Answer: D. $4.73
Explanation:
Saving = 25% of cover price = 25/100 * cover price = (1/4) * cover price
15 * (1/4) * cover price = $42.00
cover price = $42.00 * 4 = $168.00
Answer: D. $4.73
Explanation:
Saving = 25% of cover price = 25/100 * cover price = (1/4) * cover price

If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure? options: A)58.3%, B)62.5%, C)63.5%, D)64.5%, E)65.5%
Output: 
Let the income be x.
Then, 70% of x = x*70/100 = 70x/100
If the income increases by 20%, then the new income will be x+20.
Then, 70x/100 = x+20
70x = 120
x = 120/70 = 12/7
New expenditure = (70/100)*(12/7) = (6/7)*(120/70) = (6*120)/(7*70) = (720/490) = (6*6)/(7*7) = 6/7

What is the distance travelled by the jeep?","['A)126km', 'B)144km', 'C)127km', 'D)228km', 'E)128km']",B,"Instruction: A jeep travels a certain distance taking 6 hours in the forward journey. During the return journey, it increased its speed by 12km/hr and took 4 hours. What is the distance travelled by the jeep? options: A)126km, B)144km, C)127km, D)228km, E)128km
Output: 
Let the distance travelled by the jeep be x km.
Speed of the jeep in the forward journey = x/6 km/hr
Speed of the jeep in the return journey = (x+12)/4 km/hr
Distance travelled by the jeep = x/6 + (x+12)/4 = x/2 + 3x/4 = x/2 + 3x/4 = x/2 + 3x/4 = x/2 + 3x/4 = x/2 + 3x/4 = x/2 + 3x/4 = x/2 + 3x/4 = x/2 + 3x/4 = x/2 + 3x/4 = x/2 + 3x/4 = x/2 + 3x/4 = x/2 + 3x/4 = x/2 + 3x/4 = x/2 + 3x/4 = x/2 + 3x/4 = x/2 + 3x/4 = x/2 + 3x/4 = x/2 + 3x/4 = x/2 + 3x/4 = x/2 + 3x/4 = x"

What is the final concentration of tea John drinks? options: A)15.38%, B)42%, C)39.86%, D)22.35%, E)32.51%
Output: 
Let the concentration of milk tea be x.
Then, the concentration of tea is (100-15-10)/100 = 85/100
(85/100)x = (85/100)(x-15-10)
85x = 85x-225
85x-85x = 225
