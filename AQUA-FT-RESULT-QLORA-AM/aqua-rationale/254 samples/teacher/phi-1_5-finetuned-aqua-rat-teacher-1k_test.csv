Output: 

The question is asking for the total number of distinct bike no.s that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.s. To do this, we need to first find the number of distinct bike no.s that can be formed using 2 letters.

There are a total of 26 letters in the alphabet, and each letter can be used to form a distinct bike no.

Therefore, the number of distinct bike no.s that can be formed using 2 letters is 26.

Next, we need to find the number of distinct bike no.s that can be formed using 2 no.s.

There are a total of 2^2 = 4 distinct bike no.s that can be formed using 2 no.s.

Therefore, the total number of distinct bike no.s that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.s is 26 * 4 = 104.

Output: 

The area of a square is given by the formula A = s^2, where A is the area and s is the length of one side.

Given that the side length of the square is 20 cm, we can find the area as follows:

A = 20^2 = 400 cm^2

The area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius.

Since the diameter of the circle is twice the length of the side, we can find the radius as follows:

r = 20/2 = 10 cm

The area of the circle is given by the formula A = πr^2 = π(10)^2 = 314 cm^2

Therefore, the area of the remaining paper is:

A = 400 - 314 = 86 cm^2

**Explanation:**

The sales person's salary is $1000 and he gets a 10% commission on each sale. So, to reach a salary of at least $1000, he must make enough sales to earn $1000 * 10% = $100.

To find out how many sales of $250 each he must make, we need to divide $100 by $250 = 0.4.

Therefore, the number of sales of $250 each he must make is 0.4 * 1000 = 400.

The original retail price of the appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?

**Step 1:** Calculate the original retail price.

The original retail price is 60 percent more than the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price, we need to multiply the wholesale cost by 1.60.

**Step 2:** Calculate the discounted price.

The discounted price is 20 percent less than the original retail price. To find the discounted price, we need to multiply the original retail price by 0.80.

**Step 3:** Calculate the profit.

The profit is the difference between the original retail price and the discounted price. To find the profit, we need to subtract the discounted price from the original retail price.

Instruction: For bringing each copper coin from the bottom of a river, a coin-diver gets 20 cents, and for each brass coin she gets 25 cents. If after one dive, she got $3.40. What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought? options: A)4, B)3, C)2, D)1, E)0
Output: 

The information provided is as follows:

- The coin-diver gets 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin.
- The total amount of money earned is $3.40.

We know that the total amount earned is equal to the number of coins brought multiplied by the value of each coin.

Let's calculate the number of coins brought for each type of coin:

- For copper coins, the number of coins brought is equal to the total amount earned divided by the value of each coin.
- For brass coins, the number of coins brought is equal to the total amount earned divided by the value of each coin.

Now, we can find the minimum number of coins that the coin-diver brought:

- For copper coins, the number of coins brought is $3.40 divided by 20 cents = 12 coins.
- For brass coins, the number of coins brought is $3.40 divided by 25 cents = 1.28 coins.

Since the number of coins brought must be a whole number, the minimum number of coins that the coin-diver brought is 12 coins.

The answer is: C

Output: 

The formula for the area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = l*b, where A is the area, l is the length, and b is the breadth.

Given that the length of the rectangle is 27 cm and the breadth is 17 cm, we can substitute these values into the formula to find the area of the rectangle.

A = 27*17

A = 450 cm2

Now, we know that the area of the rectangle is 450 cm2. We also know that the area of a square is given by the formula A = s^2, where A is the area and s is the length of each side.

To find the length of each side of the square, we need to find the value of s that makes the area of the square equal to 450 cm2.

The given information is as follows:

* Last year, 34% of Ace Book Company's sales revenue came from the sale of novels.
* The remaining revenue was 1/3 of the total revenue.
* The revenue from the sale of novels was approximately equal to the revenue from the sale of biographies.

We know that the revenue from the sale of novels is 34% of the total revenue, which is equivalent to 34/100 * Total Revenue.

The remaining revenue is 1/3 of the total revenue, which is equivalent to 1/3 * Total Revenue.

Therefore, we can write the equation as:

34/100 * Total Revenue = Revenue from the sale of novels

1/3 * Total Revenue = Revenue from the sale of biographies

To find the revenue from the sale of biographies, we need to isolate the variable on one side of the equation.

1/3 * Total Revenue = Revenue from the sale of biographies

Total Revenue = Revenue from the sale of biographies * 3

Total Revenue = Revenue from the sale of biographies * 3

Output: 

The ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, which means that for every 4 boys, there are 3 girls. Therefore, if the same number of boys and girls joined the group, the number of boys would increase by 4/3 of the number of girls.

To find the total number of members in the group, we need to add the number of boys and girls. So, the total number of members in the group is 64 + 40 = 104.

Instruction: Suppose you can travel from a place M to a place N by 3 buses, from place N to place O by 4 buses, from place O to place P by 1 buses and from place P to place Q by 3 buses. In how many ways can you travel from M to Q ? options: A)24, B)36, C)72, D)84, E)None
Output: 

The question is asking how many ways you can travel from M to Q, given the information about the number of buses used to travel from M to N, N to O, O to P, and P to Q.

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways to choose 3 buses from the 3 options for traveling from M to N, 4 buses from the 4 options for traveling from N to O, 1 bus from the 1 option for traveling from O to P, and 3 buses from the 3 option for traveling from P to Q.

The formula for the number of ways to choose 3 buses from a group of 3 is given by the formula:

C(n,3) = n! / (n-3)!

where C(n,3) is the number of ways to choose 3 buses from a group of 3, n is the total number of buses, and! is the factorial function.

Substituting the values of n and 3 into the formula, we get:

C(3,3) = 3! / (3-3)! = 3! = 3

Output: 

The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost. If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?

**Step 1: Calculate the original retail price**

The original retail price is 60% more than the wholesale cost. To find the original retail price, we need to multiply the wholesale cost by 1.60.

Output: 

1. Calculate the remainder when 6 years are subtracted from the present age of Ajay.
Remainder = 6

2. Divide the remainder by 18 to find the present age of Rahul.
Age of Rahul = Remainder / 18
Age of Rahul = 6 / 18 = 0

3. Subtract 2 years from the present age of Rahul to find the present age of Denis.
Present age of Denis = Age of Rahul - 2
Present age of Denis = 0 - 2 = -2

Output: 

**Explanation:**

1. Calculate the distance traveled by Ram in 10 seconds. Distance traveled = Speed x Time = 20m/s x 10s = 200 meters.

2. Calculate the distance traveled by Krishna in 10 seconds. Distance traveled = Speed x Time = 40m/s x 10s = 400 meters.

3. Find the total distance traveled by both of them. Total distance traveled = Distance traveled by Ram + Distance traveled by Krishna = 200 meters + 400 meters = 600 meters.

**The answer is:** B

Therefore, the total distance between A to B is 700 meters.

**Note:** The answer is B because the total distance traveled by both Ram and Krishna is 600 meters, which is greater than the distance traveled by Ram alone (200 meters).

**The answer is:** B

The total distance between A to B is 700 meters.

Output: 

The question is about the number of different groups of presenters that can be chosen from a team of 4 men and 4 women.

To solve this problem, we need to first find the number of ways to choose 2 presenters from the team of 4 men and 4 women. This can be done using the combination formula, which is given by the formula C(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n-r)!), where n is the total number of presenters and r is the number of presenters to be chosen.

Therefore, the number of ways to choose 2 presenters from the team of 4 men and 4 women is C(4, 2) = 6.

Now, we need to find the number of ways to choose 2 presenters from the team of 4 men and 4 women, where at least one presenter is a man. This can be done using the combination formula, but with a modification.

The modified formula is C(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n-r)!) + C(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n-r)!) + C(4, 2","Instruction: A man borrows Rs.360 If he pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50, what is his interest rate? options: A)1.5%, B)4.5%, C)10%, D)5%, E)12%

Output: 

**Explanation:**

The health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. To obtain the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, the health food must contain at least 10% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A.

To find out how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, we need to calculate the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and vitamin A separately.

The minimum daily requirement of vitamin E is 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E. Therefore, to obtain the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E, the health food must contain at least 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E.

The minimum daily requirement of vitamin A is 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. Therefore, to obtain the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A, the health food must contain at least 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A.

Instruction: Consider there is an staircase elevator and you are coming down. If you walk 20 steps and stop, then you reach bottom in 10 minutes. If you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach to the ground in 20 minutes. What is the speed of the elevator? options: A)1 step/minute, B)2 step/minute, C)3 step/minute, D)4 step/minute, E)None of the above
Output: 

The elevator is moving downwards, so it is important to know the speed at which it is moving. We know that the time taken to reach the bottom is 10 minutes and the number of steps taken is 20. Therefore, the speed of the elevator can be calculated as:

Speed = Distance/Time

Since the elevator is moving downwards, the distance covered is the same as the number of steps taken. Therefore, the speed of the elevator is:

Speed = 20 steps/10 minutes = 2 steps/minute

Output: 

The monthly salary S of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. To reach a monthly salary of $1500, the monthly sales must be greater than $500.

To find the monthly sales, we need to first calculate the 5% of the monthly salary. This can be done as:

5% of $500 = $25

Now, we can add the fixed salary of $500 to the monthly sales to find the total monthly salary:

Total monthly salary = $500 + $25 = $525

Since the total monthly salary is equal to $1500, we can conclude that the monthly sales must be greater than $500.

The train A leaves every 16 minutes and train B leaves every 17 minutes. So, the total time taken by train A to complete its journey is 16 minutes and the total time taken by train B to complete its journey is 17 minutes. Therefore, the total time taken by both trains to complete their journey is 16 + 17 = 33 minutes.

The distance between the two farms is 75 cm. So, the distance traveled by ant A in 33 minutes is 9 cm per minute * 33 minutes = 324 cm.

The distance traveled by ant B in 33 minutes is 6 cm per minute * 33 minutes = 198 cm.

The total distance traveled by ant A is 324 cm and the total distance traveled by ant B is 198 cm. Therefore, the total distance traveled by both ants is 324 + 198 = 544 cm.

Output: 

The manufacturer of tyres is offering a 20% discount on the price of its tubeless tyres. Some retailers are offering additional discounts. If a retailer offers an additional 20% discount, then what is the total discount available at that retailer?

**Explanation:**

The total discount available at a retailer is the sum of the discounts offered by the manufacturer and the additional discount offered by the retailer.

The manufacturer's discount is 20%, which means that the price of the tubeless tyres will be reduced by 20%. Therefore, the remaining price of the tubeless tyres will be 100% - 20% = 80% of the original price.

The additional discount offered by the retailer is 20%, which means that the price of the tubeless tyres will be reduced by 20%. Therefore, the remaining price of the tubeless tyres will be 80% - 20% = 60% of the original price.

The total discount available at that retailer is 60% of the original price.

Instruction: The ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which will fit inside the cube is? options: A)2: π, B)7:2, C)8:2, D)6: π, E)8:3
Output: 

The volume of a cube is given by the formula V = a^3, where V is the volume of the cube and a is the length of one side of the cube. The volume of a sphere is given by the formula V = (4/3)πr^3, where V is the volume of the sphere and r is the radius of the sphere.

Since the volume of the cube is equal to the volume of the sphere, we can write:

V = (4/3)πr^3

Substituting the value of V from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

(4/3)πr^3 = (4/3)πr^3

Therefore, the ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of a sphere which will fit inside the cube is equal to 2:π.

Output: 

The perimeter of a rectangular plot is given by the formula 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width of the plot. If the perimeter is 340 metres and the width is unknown, then we can find the width by dividing the perimeter by 2 and then multiplying by the length.

w = 340/2 = 170

The area of a rectangular plot is given by the formula lw, where l is the length and w is the width of the plot. If the area is unknown, then we can find the area by multiplying the length and width.

l = 1

lw = 1 * 170 = 170

Therefore, the cost of gardening 1-metre – broad boundary around a rectangular plot with perimeter of 340 metres at the rate of 10 per square metre is $3400.

Output: 

The distance traveled by a point on the edge of a fan blade that is rotating in a plane 10 centimeters from the center of the fan is directly proportional to the rate of revolutions per minute.

Given that the fan runs at the rate of 300 revolutions per minute, the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade in 30 seconds will be 300 revolutions per minute multiplied by 30 seconds, which is 9600 revolutions.

The distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade is directly proportional to the circumference of the fan blade.

Therefore, the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade is 75% of the circumference of the fan blade.

The circumference of the fan blade is 10 centimeters.

Instruction: Joe's age, Joe's sister's age and Joe’s fathers age sums up to 100. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Find the age of Joe's father? options: A)45, B)48, C)50, D)55, E)58
Output: 

Joe's age, Joe's sister's age and Joe's father's age sums up to 100. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as his father.

We know that Joe's age, Joe's sister's age and Joe's father's age sums up to 100. So, we can write:

Joe's age + Joe's sister's age + Joe's father's age = 100

If Joe is as old as his father, then Joe's father's age = 100 - Joe's age

If Joe is as old as his father, then Joe's sister's age = 2 * Joe's father's age

Substituting the above into the above equation, we get:

100 - Joe's age = 2 * Joe's father's age

Solving for Joe's father's age, we get:

Joe's father's age = 100 - Joe's age + 2 * Joe's father's age

Joe's father's age = 100 - Joe's age + 2 * Joe's","Instruction: What will be the cost of gardening 1-metre – broad boundary around a rectangular plot having perimeter of 340 metres at the rate of 10 per square metre? options: A)3400, B)1700, C)3440, D)Cannot be determined, E)None of these

Output: 

The cost of gardening 1-metre – broad boundary around a rectangular plot has a perimeter of 340 metres. To find the cost of gardening 1-metre, we need to find the area of the garden. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = l*w, where A is the area, l is the length, and w is the width.

Given that the perimeter is 340 metres, we know that the length and width of the garden are equal. Therefore, the length of the garden is 40 metres.

The area of the garden is A = 40*40 = 1600 square metres.

The cost of gardening 1-metre is $42.00, which represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices. So, the cost per square metre is $42.00/1600 = $0.25.

Given information:
- Height of the room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5.
- Cost of paper for walls is Rs.260.
- Area of doors and windows is 15 sq.m.

Formula for the area of a room is given by the formula A = 2h/2s, where A is the area of the room, h is the height of the room, and s is the length of the room.

Substituting the values of h and s into the formula, we get:

A = 2h/2s

Since A is equal to the area of the room, we can write:

2h/2s = A

Since A is equal to Rs.260, we can write:

2h/2s = 260

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

Output: 

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = l*b, where A is the area, l is the length, and b is the breadth.

Given that the area is 150 sq m, we can find the length and breadth as follows:

l = 4b + 1

l = 4(4b) + 1

l = 16b + 1

l = 16b + 1

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2l + 2b, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and b is the breadth.

Substituting the values of l and b into the formula, we get:

P = 2(16b + 1) + 2b

P = 32b + 2 + 2b

P = 34b + 2

To ensure that the yearly profit is at least $626,400, the profit must be greater than $626,400. Therefore, we need to find the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the profit is at least $626,400.

Output: 

The given information is:

M = abc and N = cba

We know that M > N and M - N + 396c = 990.

To find the values of M that are more than 300, we need to find the values of M that satisfy the above equation.

First, we need to find the value of M that satisfies the equation M - N + 396c = 990.

M - N = 990 - 396c

M = 990 + 396c

Now, we need to find the values of M that are more than 300.

To do this, we need to find the values of M that are greater than 300.

M > 300

The values of M that are greater than 300 are:

M = 990 + 396c, M = 1200 + 396c, M = 1400 + 396c, M = 1600 + 396c, M = 1800 + 396c

The given information is:

- Time taken for the forward journey = 6 hours
- Speed of the jeep during the forward journey = 55km/hr

We know that the speed of the jeep increases by 12km/hr during the return journey. So, the speed of the jeep during the return journey is 55 + 12 = 67km/hr.

The formula for the distance travelled by a vehicle is given by the formula:

Output: Answer: A

Instruction: If 120 is reduced to 96, what is the reduction percent? options: A)30%, B)40%, C)20%, D)10%, E)5%
Output: 

The given information is as follows:

The height of the electric pole (h) is 14 meters and the height of the tree (t) is unknown.

The shadow of the electric pole (s) is 10 meters and the shadow of the tree (t') is 15 meters.

We know that the height of the tree (t) is equal to the height of the electric pole (h) multiplied by the height of the tree's shadow (t') divided by the height of the electric pole's shadow (s).

Therefore, we can write the equation as:

t = h * t' / s

Substituting the values of h and t' into this equation, we get:

t = 14 * 15 / 10 = 21

The reduction in height is 21 - 14 = 7 meters.

The reduction percent is 7/14 * 100% = 42.86%

Output: 

The sum of the digits of a three-digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109. If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order.

To find the number, we need to find the number that satisfies the above conditions.

Let's find the number first.

If the sum of the digits is 17, then the number must be divisible by 17.

If the sum of the squares of the digits is 109, then the number must be divisible by 9.

If we subtract 495 from the number, we get a number that is divisible by 17 and 9.

The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires? options: A)8%, B)10%, C)12.5%, D)16.7%, E)25%
Output: 

The cost of repairing the current tires is $40 per tire, which means that the average cost per year of repairing the current tires is $40. The cost of purchasing the new tires is $180 per tire, which means that the average cost per year of purchasing the new tires is $180. Therefore, the average cost per year of the new tires is $180 - $40 = $140. The average cost per year of repairing the current tires is $40, which means that the average cost per year of repairing the current tires is $40. The difference between the average cost per year of purchasing the new tires and repairing the current tires is $140 - $40 = $100. The percentage increase in the average cost per year of purchasing the new tires is $100 / $40 * 100% = 250%.

Output: 

The average speed for two activities combined is given by the formula:

Average speed = Total distance traveled / Total time taken

Since the athlete runs M miles and rides a bike N miles, the total distance traveled is M + N. The total time taken is 4 hours.

Therefore, the average speed for these two activities combined is:

Average speed = M + N / 4

Since M is divisible by 9 and 12, and N is also divisible by 9 and 12, we can conclude that the average speed for these two activities combined is:

Average speed = M + N / 4 = M + N / 9 = 36

The answer is: A) 36

Instruction: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°.

Output: 

The car is traveling at a constant speed, so the distance traveled by the car is directly proportional to the time taken. As the angle of elevation changes, the distance traveled also changes. Therefore, the time taken to reach the base of the tower will increase as the angle of elevation increases.

The time taken to reach the base of the tower is 10 minutes. So, the distance traveled by the car will increase by a factor of 10. The distance traveled by the car is 450 grams. Therefore, the additional time required to reach the base of the tower is 10 minutes * 10 = 100 grams.

Output: 

The given information is as follows:

* The shopkeeper gives a discount of 5%.
* If he gives a discount of 7%, he earns Rs. 15 less as profit.

We know that the profit is directly proportional to the marked price. So, if the marked price is Rs. 697.50, then the profit earned is 5% of Rs. 697.50 = Rs. 30.50. If the marked price is Rs. 712.50, then the profit earned is 7% of Rs. 712.50 = Rs. 46.25. Therefore, the profit earned is Rs. 30.50 - Rs. 46.25 = Rs. 15.25.

Instruction: Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other? options: A)3 hours, B)5 hours, C)6 hours, D)4 hours, E)7 hours
Output: 

The first car travels at a rate of 55 mph, which means that it covers a distance of 55 miles per hour. The second car travels at a rate of 52 mph, which means that it covers a distance of 52 miles per hour. Therefore, the total distance covered by both cars is 15 miles.

The time taken to cover this distance is equal to the distance covered divided by the rate of travel. So, the time taken by the first car is 15 miles / 55 mph = 0.273 hours. The time taken by the second car is 15 miles / 52 mph = 0.273 hours.

Therefore, the total time taken by both cars is 0.273 hours + 0.273 hours = 0.546 hours.

The information provided is as follows:

* The bag of cat food weighs 7 pounds and 4 ounces.
* 10% of the staplers produced on Monday were defective.
* 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake.
* 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected.

**Step 1: Convert 7 pounds and 4 ounces to ounces.**

7 pounds = 7 * 16 ounces = 112 ounces
4 ounces = 4 ounces

**Step 2: Calculate the number of defective staplers.**

10% of the staplers produced on Monday were defective, so the number of defective staplers is 10% of the total number of staplers produced.

Output: 

The formula for compound interest is given by the formula A = Pe(r/n)n, where A is the future value, P is the principal, e is the base of the natural logarithm, r is the annual interest rate, and n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year.

Given that the future value (A) is $54,080, the annual interest rate (r) is 8%, and the number of times the interest is compounded per year (n) is 2, we can substitute these values into the formula to find the principal (P).

A = Pe(r/n)n
54,080 = Pe(0.08/2)2
54,080 = Pe(0.04)
54,080 = 0.04P
P = 54,080 * 100
P = $540,000

Output: 

**Step 1:** Calculate the perimeter of the sheet folded along one set of sides.
Perimeter = 2(length + width)

Since the perimeter is 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides, we can write:

2(length + width) = 48

**Step 2:** Calculate the perimeter of the sheet folded along the other set of sides.
Perimeter = 2(length + width)

Since the perimeter is 66cm for each part folded along the other set of sides, we can write:

2(length + width) = 66

**Step 3:** Find the area of the sheet.
Area = length x width

Since the perimeter is equal to the length of the sheet folded along one set of sides and the width of the sheet folded along the other set of sides, we can write:

2(length + width) = area

**Step 4:** Substitute the values of length and width into the equation.
2(length + width) = area

**Step 5:** Solve for area.
2(length + width) = area

Output: 

The given information is as follows:

Perimeter of the rectangular plot = 340 meters
Cost of gardening per square metre = 10

We know that the perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula 2(length + width). So, we can find the length and width of the rectangular plot as follows:

2(length + width) = 340

length + width = 170

Since the cost of gardening per square metre is 10, the area of the rectangular plot is given by the formula A = lw, where A is the area, l is the length, and w is the width.

A = lw = 10lw = 10(170) = 1700 square metres

The cost of gardening 1-metre – broad boundary around the rectangular plot is 10 per square metre, so the total cost of gardening 1-metre – broad boundary around the rectangular plot is 1700 square metres * 10 = 1700 dollars.

Output: 

**Explanation:**

Given the information, we know that x<0, y>0, and |x^3|>|y^2| are all true.

If x<0, then y>0. This means that y is positive.

If y^2 > x^2, then x^3 is greater than y^2. This means that x is positive.

If x^3 < y^2, then x is negative. This means that y is negative.

If x<y, then x is negative. This means that y is positive.

If x>y, then x is positive. This means that y is negative.

Therefore, the answer is D: 29.

**The answer is:** D) 28

The answer is 28.

**Note:** The answer is 28 because Meenu weighs 29 Kgs plus half of her weight. Half of her weight is 15 Kgs. So, the total weight of Meenu is 29 Kgs + 15 Kgs = 44 Kgs.

Output: 

**Step 1: Calculate the average weight of the 10 oarsmen before the replacement.**

The average weight of the 10 oarsmen is increased by 1.8 kg, so the new average weight is 53 kg + 1.8 kg = 54.8 kg.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of oarsmen that were replaced.**

One oarman was replaced, so the number of oarsmen that were replaced is 1.

**Step 3: Calculate the new average weight of the oarsmen.**

The new average weight of the oarsmen is 54.8 kg, so the new average weight is 54.8 kg / 9 oarsmen = 6.8 kg.

**The answer is:** D

The new man's weight is increased by 1.8 kg, so the new weight is 53 kg + 1.8 kg = 54.8 kg.

Output: 

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = l * w, where A is the area, l is the length, and w is the width. We know that the area of the yard is 3,000 square feet and one side of the yard is 100 feet wide. So, the area of the other side of the yard is 3,000 - 100 * 100 = 2,000 square feet. To find the length of the other side, we need to divide the area of the other side by the width of the other side. Therefore, the length of the other side of the yard is 2,000 / 100 = 20 feet.

Output: 

The shopkeeper's monthly salary is 1500 and he agreed to pay a commission of 15% on the monthly sale. So, the total income of the servant will be 1500 + 15% of the monthly sale.

To find out the monthly sale, we need to divide the total income by the commission rate.

The monthly sale is 6000 - 1500 = 4500.

Output: 

The formula for the simple interest (S.I.) on a bond is given by the formula:

S.I. = P * R * T

where S.I. is the simple interest, P is the principal, R is the rate of interest per period, and T is the number of periods.

Given the information, we know that P = $5,000, R = 12%, and T = 1 year. So, we can substitute these values into the formula as:

S.I. = $5,000 * 12% * 1

S.I. = $600

Output: 

The bus fare of one adult is Rs. 140 and the bus fare of a child is half the fare of one adult. So, the total bus fare of 4 adults is 4 x 140 = Rs. 560 and the total bus fare of 3 children is 3 x 140 = Rs. 420. Therefore, the total bus fare of 4 adults and 3 children is Rs. 560 + Rs. 420 = Rs. 980.

The answer is: D

The answer is: D) 56 minutes.

The explanation:

The train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9am. So, the total time taken by train M is 9 - 5 = 4 hours.

The train N leaves City B at 7am and reaches City A at 1030am. So, the total time taken by train N is 1030 - 7 = 8 hours.

The total time taken by both trains is 4 + 8 = 12 hours.

The total bus fare of 4 adults is 4 x 140 = Rs. 560 and the total bus fare of 3 children is 3 x 140 = Rs. 420. Therefore, the total bus fare of 4 adults and 3 children is Rs. 560","Instruction: A train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9am.

Output: 

The area of a triangle is given by the formula A = 1/2(a*b*h), where A is the area, a and b are the lengths of the two bases, and h is the height.

Given that a>x>b>0>y, we can see that the height is always greater than the base, so the area will be greater than 0.

Therefore, the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money in order to take advantage of the discount is B, which is 237.67.

Instruction: A bag contains 11 candy bars: three cost 50 cents each, four cost $1 each and four cost $2
each. How many ways can 3 candy bars be selected from the 11 candy bars so that the total cost is more than $4? options: A)8, B)28, C)46, D)66, E)70
Output: 

There are a total of 11 candy bars in the bag. There are a total of 11C3 ways to select 3 candy bars from the 11 candy bars.

The cost of each candy bar is 50 cents, so the total cost of 3 candy bars that cost 50 cents each is 3 * 50 cents = $1.50.

The cost of each candy bar that costs $1 is $1, so the total cost of 3 candy bars that cost $1 each is 3 * $1 = $3.

The cost of each candy bar that costs $2 is $2, so the total cost of 3 candy bars that cost $2 each is 3 * $2 = $6.

Therefore, the total cost of 3 candy bars that cost $1, $1 and $2 is $1.50 + $3 + $6 = $10.

Since the total cost of 3 candy bars is more than $4, the answer is B) 41.

Output: 

The average weight of 10 oarsmen in a boat is increased by 1.8 kg when one of the crew, who weighs 53 kg is replaced by a new man. So, the total weight of the 10 oarsmen is now 10 + 1.8 = 11.8 kg.

Therefore, the volume of the solid is also given by the formula V = 3lwh.

Since the volume of the solid is equal to the volume of the sphere, we can write the equation as:

V = V(sphere)

Substituting the values of V and V(sphere) into the above equation, we get:

3lwh = 3(V(sphere))

Dividing both sides of the equation by 3, we get:

lwh = V(sphere)

Since all eight vertices of the solid are on the sphere, we can also write the equation as:

lwh = 8(V(sphere))

Output: 

The coin will land on heads approximately 16.66 times out of 20 flips. Therefore, the number of times the coin landed on heads is 16.

**The answer is:** C

The total amount of money Christopher will give to Jonathan is $2 for each time the coin lands on heads, therefore, the total amount of money Christopher will give to Jonathan is $2 x 16.66 = $33.32.

The total amount of money Jonathan will give to Christopher is $3 for each time the coin lands on tails, therefore, the total amount of money Jonathan will give to Christopher is $3 x 16.66 = $50.32.

The total amount of money given to Jonathan is $33.32 + $50.32 = $83.64.

Output: 

**Step 1:** Calculate the area of the original square piece of cloth.

The area of a square is given by the formula A = s^2, where A is the area and s is the length of one side of the square.

If the area of the original square piece of cloth is unknown, we need to find out the length of one side of the square first.

**Step 2:** Find the length of one side of the square.

To find the length of one side of the square, we need to take the square root of the area of the original square piece of cloth.

Output: 

The number of ways to select two balls from a box containing balls numbered from 1 to n is given by the formula nC2, where n is the number of balls in the box and C is the combination formula.

Since there are 45 different ways to select two balls from a box containing balls numbered from 1 to n, and there are only 45 ways to select a ball with number 3 marked on it, the number of balls in the box that have number 3 marked on them is 45.

Therefore, the number of balls in the box that do not have number 3 marked on them is n - 45.

The number of ways to select two balls from a box containing balls numbered from 1 to n is given by the formula nC2, where n is the number of balls in the box and C is the combination formula.

Since there are 45 balls in the box and 45 balls in the box that do not have number 3 marked on them, the number of balls in the box that have number 3 marked on them is 45.

Therefore, the number of balls in the box that do not have number 3 marked on them is 45 - 45 = 0.

Output: 

The average wage for the first 7 days was $87 per day, which means that the total wage for the first 7 days was $87 x 7 = $588. The average wage for the last 7 days was $92 per day, which means that the total wage for the last 7 days was $92 x 7 = $616. Therefore, the total wage for the fortnight was $588 + $616 = $1040. To find out the wage on the 8th day, we need to divide $1040 by the total number of days in the fortnight, which is 15. This will give us the wage on the 8th day, which is $1040 / 15 = $73.33.

The given information is as follows:

- Joe's age, Joe's sister's age and Joe's father's age sum up to 100.
- When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now.
- When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as his father.

We know that Joe's age, Joe's sister's age and Joe's father's age sum up to 100. So, we can write:

Joe's age + Joe's sister's age + Joe's father's age = 100

We also know that when Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. So, we can write:

Joe's age = 2 * Joe's father's age

When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's father's age will be twice as old as when his sister was as old as his father. So, we can write:

Joe's father's age = 2 * Joe's sister's father's age

Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:

The minimum daily requirement of vitamin E is 9% of the daily requirement of vitamin E and 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. Therefore, to obtain the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, a total of 9% + 8% = 17% of the daily requirement of vitamin E and vitamin A must be obtained from the health food.

To find out how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, we need to divide the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and vitamin A by the percentage of the daily requirement that each gram of the health food provides.

The daily requirement of vitamin E is 9% of the daily requirement of vitamin E and 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. Therefore, the daily requirement of vitamin E is 9% + 8% = 17%.

The daily requirement of vitamin A is 8% of the daily requirement of vitamin A and 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. Therefore, the daily requirement of vitamin A is 8% + 8% = 16%.

**Explanation:**

Given information:
- Q is younger than R
- Q is older than T
- Q's age is equal to R's age
- Q's age is equal to T's age
- Q's age is equal to the sum of R's and T's age

We know that Q's age is equal to R's age, so we can find R's age by subtracting Q's age from the sum of R's and T's age.

R's age = T's age + Q's age

R's age = 50 + Q's age

R's age = 50 + Q

**Therefore, the answer is:**

**The answer is:** B) 5723

**Explanation:**

Substituting the value of Q's age in the equation, we get:

R's age = 50 + Q

R's age = 50 + Q

R's age = 50 + Q

R's age = 50 + Q

**Therefore, the answer is:** B) 5723

Output: 

The question is asking how much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days. We know that the work completed by x men working x hours per day is equal to the cover price of a magazine. Therefore, we can write the equation as:

x * x * x = 42.00

To find the cover price per issue, we need to find the value of x that will make the equation true. We can do this by finding the value of x that makes the equation true for the first time.

If x = 1, then the equation becomes:

1 * 1 * 1 = 42.00

This is not true, so we need to find a value of x that makes the equation true for the second time.

If x = 2, then the equation becomes:

2 * 2 * 2 = 42.00

This is also not true, so we need to find a value of x that makes the equation true for the third time.

If x = 3, then the equation becomes:

3 * 3 * 3 = 42.00

This is true, so the cover price per issue is $7","Instruction: If a subscription for 15 issues of a magazine costs $42.00 and represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices, what is the cover price per issue? options: A)$7.73, B)$6.73, C)$5.73, D)$4.73, E)$3.73

How many of each are there? options: A)453, B)651, C)400, D)487, E)286
Output: 

**Explanation:**

1. Calculate the total number of 25 paise coins, 50 paise coins and one rupee coins.
Total number of 25 paise coins = 2 * Number of 25 paise coins
Total number of 50 paise coins = 2 * Number of 50 paise coins
Total number of one rupee coins = 1 * Number of one rupee coins

2. Calculate the total value of the money pouch.
Total value = Total number of 25 paise coins * Value of 25 paise coins + Total number of 50 paise coins * Value of 50 paise coins + Total number of one rupee coins * Value of one rupee coin

3. Calculate the interest earned on the money pouch.
Interest earned = Total value * Interest rate

**The answer is:** B

Therefore, the total number of 25 paise coins, 50 paise coins and one rupee coins is 2 * Number of 25 paise coins, 2 * Number of 50 paise coins and 1 * Number of one rupee coins.

Output: 

Jim's dog ate 1/3 of the food remaining in the bowl at each feeding session. Therefore, the total amount of food remaining in the bowl at the beginning of the day was 1.

At noon, the dog began to eat, so the amount of food remaining in the bowl decreased by 1/3 of the original amount. Therefore, the total amount of food remaining in the bowl at noon was 1 - 1/3 = 2/3 of the original amount.

The original amount of food in the bowl was 1. Therefore, the percentage of the original food that was in the bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon was 2/3 * 100% = 66.66%.

Instruction: What is the largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation x2 - 5x + k = 0 will have two real and distinct roots? options: A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12
Output: 

The quadratic equation is given by the formula x2 - 5x + k = 0. To find the largest integral value of 'k', we need to find the value of 'k' that makes the equation have two distinct roots.

To find the value of 'k', we need to find the values of 'x' that make the equation equal to zero. To do this, we can use the quadratic formula:

x = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a

where 'a', 'b', and 'c' are the coefficients of the quadratic equation.

Substituting the values of 'a', 'b', and 'c' into the quadratic formula, we get:

x = (-(-5) ± sqrt((-5)^2 - 4(1)(k))) / 2(1)

x = (5 ± sqrt(25 - 4k)) / 2

Since 'k' is the common difference, the value of 'k' that makes the equation have two distinct roots is:

k = 3

The answer is: C

If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob? options: A)15, B)16, C)17, D)18, E)19
Output: 

**Explanation:**

1. Calculate the total number of hours worked by Alex and Jacob.
Alex works for 7 hours and Jacob works for 9 hours, so the total number of hours worked is 7 + 9 = 16 hours.

2. Calculate the number of toys made by each person.
Alex can make 7 toys in 16 hours, so the number of toys made by Alex is 7/16 of the total number of toys made.

3. Calculate the number of toys made by Jacob.
Jacob can make 9 toys in 16 hours, so the number of toys made by Jacob is 9/16 of the total number of toys made.

4. Calculate the number of toys made by Jacob.
The number of toys made by Jacob is equal to the number of toys made by both Alex and Jacob, which is 9/16 of the total number of toys made.

Therefore, the answer is B) 16.

Output: 

The information provided is as follows:

* Total number of chocolates = 100%
* 10% of chocolates are cocoa flavored
* 90% of the rest are squashed

We know that 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, so the remaining 90% must be squashed. Therefore, the remaining 90% of chocolates are not squashed.

To find the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed, we need to find the intersection of the two sets.

The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets.

The intersection of vanilla and not squashed chocolates is 10% of the remaining 90% of chocolates.

10% of 90% = 9%

Therefore, the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is 9%.

Output: 

**Step 1: Calculate the perimeter of the yard.**

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

Given that the area of the yard is 240 square meters and the side length of the yard is 10 meters, we can find the length and width of the yard as follows:

l = 2w

l = 2(10) = 20 meters

w = 20

**Step 2: Calculate the perimeter of the fence.**

Since Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of the yard and leave one side unfenced, she will need to put up fencing around the three sides of the yard and leave one side unfenced. Therefore, the total length of fencing needed is 3(20) = 60 meters.

**The answer is:** E

The cost of six sodas and seven bars is 300 cents. If the costs of the items do not change, the cost of six sodas and seven bars is 600 cents.

Output: 

The quadratic equation is given by the formula x^2 + mx + 22 = 0. We know that one of the roots of the equation is 1.5, so we can substitute this value into the formula to find the value of m.

1.5x^2 + mx + 22 = 0
1.5x^2 + mx + 22 = 0

To find the value of m, we need to find the value of m that makes the equation true. We can do this by finding the value of m that makes the equation equal to zero.

1.5x^2 + mx + 22 = 0

1.5x^2 + mx + 22 = 0

1.5x^2 + mx + 22 = 0

m = 0

The answer is: A) 4 1/3 km/h

The average speed is given by the formula speed = distance/time. The distance traveled is 5 kmph * 6 hours = 30 km. The time traveled is 4 kmph * 12 hours = 48 hours. Therefore, the average speed is 30 km/48 hours = 5/8 km/","Instruction: A man walks at 5 kmph for 6 hrs and at 4 kmph for 12 hrs.

Output: 

**Step 1: Calculate the discounted price:**

The original price is discounted by 22%, so the discounted price is 88% of the original price.

**Step 2: Calculate the amount of the coupon:**

The customer used a $20-off coupon, so the amount of the coupon is $20.

**Step 3: Calculate the final price:**

The final price is the discounted price minus the coupon, which is 88% of the original price minus $20.

**Step 4: Calculate the additional amount paid:**

The customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price, so the additional amount paid is $1.90.

**Step 5: Calculate the original price:**

The original price is the discounted price plus the additional amount paid, which is 88% of the original price plus $1.90.

Output: 

The formula for average speed is given by the formula:

Average speed = Total distance traveled / Total time taken

where Total distance traveled is the distance traveled at the first speed and time taken is the time taken at the second speed.

Therefore, the total distance traveled is 6 x 5 = 30 km and the total time taken is 6 x 6 = 36 hours.

The average speed at 5 kmph is 30 / 36 = 0.833 km/h

The average speed at 4 kmph is 30 / 12 = 2.5 km/h

The average speed is 0.833 + 2.5 = 3.083 km/h

Find Mohan's share. options: A)2400, B)2500, C)2600, D)2700, E)None of these
Output: 

The formula for compound interest is given by the formula A = Pe(r/n)n*t, where A is the future value, P is the principal, e is the base of the natural logarithm, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the number of years.

Given that the compound interest is equal to the area of the trapezium, we can see that the area of the trapezium is equal to the sum of the areas of the two bases and the height. Therefore, we can find the area of the base by dividing the area of the trapezium by 2.

The area of the base is 10 m * 6 m = 60 square meters.

The area of the height is unknown.

The formula for the area of a trapezium is given by the formula A = (b + h) * h/2, where A is the area of the trapezium, b is the length of the bottom base, h is the height, and h/2 is the length of the top base.

Instruction: Two balls A and B rotate along a circular track. Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes. Ball B makes 5 full rotation in 35 minutes.

Output: 

The question is about the number of sales of $250 each that a sales person must make in order to reach a salary of at least $1000.

To find the number of sales of $250 each that a sales person must make in order to reach a salary of at least $1000, we need to find the number of sales that will result in a total revenue of $1000.

The formula for calculating the total revenue is:

Total Revenue = Revenue per Sale x Number of Sales

We know that the revenue per sale is 10% of the sale amount, which is $250. So, we can write:

Total Revenue = 0.10 x Sale Amount

To reach a salary of at least $1000, the total revenue must be greater than or equal to $1000. Therefore, we can write:

Total Revenue >= $1000

Substituting the values of Revenue per Sale and Sale Amount into the above equation, we get:

0.10 x Sale Amount >= $1000

Sale Amount >= $1000 / 0.10

Sale Amount >= $1000

Therefore, the number of sales of $250 each that a sales","Instruction: A sales person gets a 10% commission on each sale he makes. How many sales of $250 each must he make in order to reach a salary of at least $1000? options: A)15, B)24, C)25, D)40, E)52

The company's revenue from the sale of novels was approximately, how many times its revenue from the sale of biographies? options: A)1.3, B)1.5, C)2.1, D)2.5, E)3.1
Output: 

**Step 1: Calculate the revenue from the sale of biographies.**

1/3 of the remaining revenue is from the sale of biographies, which is 1/3 * (1 - 34%) = 1/3 * 26% = 8/26 = 2/13

**Step 2: Calculate the revenue from the sale of novels.**

The revenue from the sale of novels is approximately 34% of the total revenue, which is 34/100 * Total Revenue = 34/100 * Revenue from Biographies

**Therefore, the ratio of revenue from novels to revenue from biographies is:**

34/100 * Revenue from Biographies = 2/13
