Output: 
Let the weight of the coin be x grams.
Then, the weight of the coin measuring 1 x 30 mm = x grams.
The volume of aluminum in the alloy = 2x/3
The volume of silver in the alloy = x/2
The weight of the coin = (2x/3) x (15 x 2) = 30 grams

How many hours will she take to cover 100 km options: A)9 hours., B)10 hours., C)11 hours., D)12 hours., E)13 hours.
Output: 
10 km/hr = 1/15 hr
10 min = 10/60 hr = 1/6 hr
100 km = (100*15)/10 = 150 km
150 km = 150*15/10 = 2250 km

Output: 
Let the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy X be 6x:9x and in alloy Y be 7x:11x.
Then, 6x + 9x = 40 and 7x + 11x = 60.
Solving the above equations, we get x = 6 and x = 7.
Therefore, the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z is 6:7.
Answer: C.
Explanation:
Let the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy X be 6x:9x and in alloy Y be 7x:11x.

Output: 
Let the original price of tubeless tyres be x.
Then, the discounted price of tubeless tyres is (x - 0.2x) = 0.8x.
Let the original price of tubeless tyres be y.
Then, the discounted price of tubeless tyres is (y - 0.2y) = 0.8y.
The total discount available at that retailer is (0.8x - 0.8y) = 0.2x.
Answer: A. 10%

The height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. The height of the room is:,"['A)2.6m', 'B)3.9m', 'C)4m', 'D)4.2m', 'E)4.4m']",C,"Instruction: The height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5.

The height of the room is: options: A)2.6m, B)3.9m, C)4m, D)4.2m, E)4.4m
Output: 
Let the height of the room be x.
Then, the length of the room is (2x + 5)
The area of the walls is (2x + 5)(2x + 5) = 4x^2 + 10x + 25
The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m
4x^2 + 10x + 25 - 15 = 0
4x^2 + 5x - 10 = 0
x = -2.5 or x = 2.5
The height of the room is 2.5m.

What is the perimeter of the piece? options: A)60 m, B)61 m, C)62 m, D)63 m, E)64 m
Output: 
Let the breadth of the piece be x m.
Then, length = 4x + 1 m.
Perimeter = 2(x + 4x + 1) = 2(5x + 1) = 10x + 2
= 10x + 2 = 150
10x = 148
x = 14.8
So, breadth = 14.8 m.
Length = 4x + 1 = 4(14.8) + 1 = 62 m.
Perimeter = 2(x + 4x + 1) = 2(5x + 1) = 10x + 2 = 10(14.8) + 2 = 62 m.
