To find the value of?, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.

First, we can simplify the left side of the equation by multiplying [5 +? × 19 - 15 - 7] by 13.

[5 +? × 19 - 15 - 7] × 13 = 6 × 13

[5 +? × 19 - 15 - 7] × 13 = 78

Next, we can isolate? by subtracting 78 from both sides of the equation.

Output: 

The monthly salary S of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales.

To find the monthly sales, we need to first calculate the 5% of all monthly sales.

5% of all monthly sales = 0.05 * S

The monthly salary S is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales.

S = $500 + 0.05 * S

S = $500 + 0.05 * $50000

S = $500 + $25000

S = $25000

The monthly sales should be $25000.

Output: 

The given information is:

The equation is:

M > N + 396c = 990

To find the number of values of M that are more than 300, we need to find the values of M that satisfy the equation.

First, we need to isolate M on one side of the equation.

M > N + 396c - 396c = 990

M > N = 990
