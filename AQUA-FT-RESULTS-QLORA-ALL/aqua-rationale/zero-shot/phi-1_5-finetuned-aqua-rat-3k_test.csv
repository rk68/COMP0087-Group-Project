"You can purchase one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents, or two sodas and three energy bars for 300
cents. If the costs of the items do not change, compute the cost in cents of six sodas and seven bars.","['A)500', 'B)600', 'C)750', 'D)800', 'E)900']",E,"Instruction: You can purchase one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents, or two sodas and three energy bars for 300
cents. If the costs of the items do not change, compute the cost in cents of six sodas and seven bars. options: A)500, B)600, C)750, D)800, E)900
Output: 
Let the cost of one soda be x cents and the cost of one energy bar be y cents.
Then,
150 = 6x + 7y
300 = 2x + 3y
Solving the above equations, we get x = 150/6 = 25 cents and y = 150/3 = 50 cents.
So, the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars is 6(25) + 7(50) = 750 cents.

Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year? options: A)20%, B)40%, C)50%, D)65%, E)75%
Output: 
Let the population of the city in the last year be x.
Then, x + 0.1x = 2x
0.1x = 1x - 2x
0.1x = -x
x = -1
The population of the city in the last year is -1.
The population of the city in the next year is -1 + 0.1(-1) = -0.9.
The population of the city in the next year is -0.9 + 0.1(-0.9) = -0.81.
The population of the city in the next year is -0.81 + 0.1(-0.81) = -0.729.
The population of the city in the next year is -0.729 + 0.1(-0.729) = -0.749.
The population of the city in the next year is -0.749 + 0.1(-0.749) = -0.749.

How much does each daughter receive ? options: A)Rs 400, B)Rs 500, C)Rs 600, D)Rs 700, E)Rs 800
Output: 
Let the amount of money given to each nephew be x.
Then, amount of money given to each daughter = 4x
Amount of money given to each son = 5x
Total amount given to 5 nephews = 5x
Total amount given to 4 daughters = 4x
Total amount given to 2 nephews = 2x
Total amount given to 5 sons = 5x
Total amount given to 5 nephews + 4 daughters + 2 nephews = 8600
5x + 4x + 2x = 8600
9x = 8600
x = 800
Amount of money given to each nephew = x = 800
Amount of money given to each daughter = 4x = 3200
Amount of money given to each son = 5x = 4000
Total amount given to 5 nephews = 5x = 5800
Total amount given to 4 daughters = 4x = 3200
Total amount given to 2 nephews = 2x = 1600
Total amount given to 5 sons = 5x = 4000
Total amount given to 5 nephews + 4 daughters + 2 nephews = 8600
5x + 4x + 2x = 8600

Output: 
Let the speed of the ship be x miles per hour.
Then, the speed of the plane is 10x miles per hour.
Distance traveled by the ship in x hours = x * x = x miles.
Distance traveled by the plane in x hours = 10x * x = 10x miles.
The total distance traveled by the ship and plane in x hours = x + 10x = 11x miles.
11x = 180
x = 180/11 = 17.64 miles per hour.
The distance traveled by the plane in x hours = 10x = 10 * 17.64 = 170.6 miles.

What is the speed of the elevator? options: A)1 step/minute, B)2 step/minute, C)3 step/minute, D)4 step/minute, E)None of the above
Output: 
Let the speed of elevator be x steps/minute.
Then, time taken to reach bottom = 20/x
time taken to reach the ground = 20/10 = 2
20/x = 20/10 = 2
x = 2

Output: 
Let the number of passing students be x and the number of failing students be y.
Then, x + y = 83*76 = 6666
x + y = 55*76 = 4400

Output: 
Let Joe's age be x, his sister's age be y and father's age be z.
Then, x + y + z = 100
y = 2z
x = 2z
z = 2x
z = 2(2x) = 4x
4x = 100
x = 25

Output: 
Let the breadth of the rectangular piece be x m.
Then, length of the rectangular piece = 4x + 1 m.
Perimeter of the rectangular piece = 2(x + 4x + 1) m = 6x + 2
= 6x + 2 = 150
x = 50
So, breadth of the rectangular piece = 50 m.
Length of the rectangular piece = 4x + 1 = 4(50) + 1 = 201 m.
Perimeter of the rectangular piece = 2(50 + 201) m = 661 m.

Output: 
Let the distance be x km.
Then, x/6 + 12 = x/4
x = (4x + 48)/12 = 4x + 4
x = 4x + 4
4x + 4 = 4x + 4
x = 4

What is the final concentration of tea John drinks? options: A)15.38%, B)42%, C)39.86%, D)22.35%, E)32.51%
Output: 
Let the concentration of tea be x.
Then, the concentration of milk in the tea is 0.85x.
The concentration of milk in the milk tea is 0.85x*0.85 = 0.7225x.
The concentration of milk in the tea after replacing 10% of the solution with more milk is 0.7225x*0.9 = 0.6975x.
The concentration of tea in the tea after replacing 15% of the solution with more milk is 0.6975x*0.85 = 0.6975x*0.85 = 0.6975x*0.8125 = 0.6975x*0.8125 = 0.6975x*0.8125 = 0.6975x*0.8125 = 0.6975x*0.8125 = 0.6975x*0.8125 = 0.6975x*0.8125 = 0.6975x*0.8125 = 0.6975x*0.8125 = 0.6975x*0.8125 = 0.6975x*0.8125 = 0.6975x"
