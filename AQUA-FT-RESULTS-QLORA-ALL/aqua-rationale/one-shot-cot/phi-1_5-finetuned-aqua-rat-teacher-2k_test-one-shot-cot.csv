Instruction: Find the total no. of distinct bike no.'s that can beformed using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s. How many letters need to be distinct? options: A)74453, B)64543, C)74325, D)65000, E)97656
Output: 

To form a distinct bike no. using 2 letters followed by 2 no.'s, we need to choose 2 letters from a total of 2 letters.

The number of distinct bike no.s that can be formed is given by the formula:

C(n,2) = n! / (n-2)! * 2!

where C(n,2) is the number of distinct bike no.s that can be formed using n letters, n-2 is the number of letters that need to be distinct, and 2! is the factorial of 2.

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:

C(2,2) = 2! / (2-2)! * 2! = 2!

Therefore, the total number of distinct bike no.s that can be formed is 2! = 2.

Instruction: Boomtown urban planners expect the city’s population to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year? options: A)20%, B)40%, C)50%, D)65%, E)75%
Output: 

The population of Boomtown is expected to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago.

To find the percent population increase, we need to calculate the percentage increase in population over one year. To do this, we need to find the percentage increase in population over one year, which is 10%.

To find the percent population increase over two years, we need to multiply the percent population increase over one year by 2. This will give us the percent population increase over two years, which is 20%.

Instruction: A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper? options: A)8.75, B)8.79, C)8.75, D)8.71, E)8.72
Output: 
The area of a square is given by the formula A = s^2, where A is the area and s is the side length.
The area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius.
If the side length of a square is 20 cm, then the area of the square is 20^2 = 400 cm^2.
If two semi circles are drawn on the opposite sides of the square, then the area of each semi circle is πr^2 = π(20)^2 = 400π cm^2.
Therefore, the total area of the two semi circles is 2 * 400π = 800π cm^2.

Instruction: Two ants are moving from their farms towards each other. Ant A is moving at a speed of 9 cm per hour and ant B is moving at a speed of 6 cm per hour. If the farms are 75 cm away from each other, what will be the distance (in cm) that ant A travels until meeting ant B? options: A)45, B)48, C)51, D)54, E)57
Output: 

The distance traveled by ant A is given by the formula:

Distance traveled = Speed x Time

Time taken by ant A = Distance/Speed

Time taken by ant B = Distance/Speed

Since the distance traveled by ant A and ant B is the same, we can equate the two expressions for time taken:

Time taken by ant A = Time taken by ant B

Substituting the values of speed and distance into this equation, we get:

9 = 6x

x = 15 cm

Therefore, the distance traveled by ant A until meeting ant B is 15 cm.

Output: Jack did 2/3 of the work, which is 8 hours. So if Jack would finish the job this would take him 4 extra hours. Jill's rate is 5% of what Jack would do in those 4 hours. That means it would take her ten times as much time as Jack put into the job. 5*4 equals 20, answer E. Answer: E

Instruction: A sales person gets a 10% commission on each sale he makes. How many sales of $250 each must he make in order to reach a salary of at least $1000? options: A)15, B)24, C)25, D)40, E)52
Output: 

The sales person gets a 10% commission on each sale he makes. So, for each sale, he earns 10% of the sale price as commission. To reach a salary of at least $1000, he must make enough sales to earn a total commission of at least $1000.

To find out how many sales he must make, we need to divide $1000 by 10% (or 0.1). This will give us the number of sales he must make to reach a salary of at least $1000.

$1000 / 0.1 = $10,000

Output: If ball A makes 2 rotations in 26 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 13 minutes. If ball B makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 7 minutes.
The two balls start rotating now and makes several rotations before they are at the SAME starting points. Ball A would have done a WHOLE number X of rotations and ball B would have done a WHOLE number Y of rotations. Also they would have rotated during the same period of time T. Hence
T = 13 X = 7 Y
Hence 13 X = 7 Y
Solve the above for X
X = 7 Y / 13
We want the time when they are FIRST at the same starting point. Therefore X and Y are the smallest whole numbers of the equation X = 7 Y / 13. The smallest value of Y that gives X as a whole number is 13. Hence
X = 7 (13) / 13 = 7
Time T is given by
T = 13 X = 13 * 7 = 91 minutes = 1 hour and 31 minutes

Output: 

The ratio of the two numbers is 3:5. If 9 is subtracted from each number, the new numbers are 12 and 23. The smaller number is the number that is in the ratio 3:5. Therefore
3/5 = 12/23
3 = 12/23

Output: If ball A makes 2 rotations in 26 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 13 minutes. If ball B makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 7 minutes.
The two balls start rotating now and makes several rotations before they are at the SAME starting points. Ball A would have done a WHOLE number X of rotations and ball B would have done a WHOLE number Y of rotations. Also they would have rotated during the same period of time T. Hence
T = 13 X = 7 Y
Hence 13 X = 7 Y

Instruction: A wire in the shape of rectangle of length 27 cm and breadth 17 cm is rebent to form a square. What will be the measure of each side? options: A)9, B)11, C)22, D)25, E)31
Output: 

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = l*b, where A is the area, l is the length, and b is the breadth.

Given the length of the rectangle is 27 cm and the breadth is 17 cm, we can find the area as A = 27*17 = 441 square cm.

To form a square, the area of the square is given by the formula A = s^2, where A is the area and s is the side length.

Since the area of the square is equal to the area of the rectangle, we can find the side length as s = √(A/b) = √(441/17) = 11 cm.

Instruction: Professors borrowed Rs. 5000 from the university at simple interest. After 3 years, the university got Rs. 300 on interest. What was the rate of interest per annum? options: A)2%, B)8%, C)5%, D)10%, E)None of these
Output: 

The formula for simple interest is given by the formula I = P*R*T, where I is the interest, P is the principal, R is the rate of interest, and T is the time period.

Given information:
P = Rs. 5000
I = Rs. 300
T = 3 years

We know that I = P*R*T, so we can substitute this into the formula as:
300 = 5000*R*3

To find the rate of interest per annum, we need to isolate R on one side of the equation.

R = 300/5000*3

R = 0.06

Output: 

The company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost of $110 per unit, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. So, the total cost of production per month is 420 x $110 = $54,600. The total revenue from sales is 420 x $1 = $420. Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 is $626,400 - $54,600 = $5,400.

Output: Let, the amount Mohan and Sohan receive be Rs. m and Rs. n, respectively. The amount that they receive 3 years and 2 years after should be equal.
⇒m(1+4/100)3=n(1+4/100)2
⇒m(1+4/100)=n
⇒m(26/25)=n
⇒m/n=25/26
Therefore, Rs.5100 must be distribued in the ratio 25 : 26
So Mohan's share = 5100×25/(25+26)=2500
Answer B Answer: B

Instruction: A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point. options: A)238, B)289, C)200, D)287, E)187
Output: 

The ship traveled 180 miles, so the speed of the ship is 180 miles per hour. The plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship, so its speed is 10x180 miles per hour = 1800 miles per hour.

When they meet, the distance traveled is equal to the speed of the ship multiplied by the time traveled. So, the distance traveled is 180 miles.

Therefore, the distance traveled by the ship is 180 miles.

The distance traveled by the plane is 1800 miles per hour multiplied by the time traveled, which is the same as the distance traveled by the ship. So, the distance traveled by the plane is 180 miles.

The distance traveled by the ship and the plane is equal to the distance traveled by the ship, which is 180 miles.

Therefore, the distance traveled by the ship and the plane is 200 miles.

Question 1: A car travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour. If the car travels for 3 hours, how many miles does it cover?

Solution:
The formula for distance traveled is given by the formula: Distance = Speed x Time.

Given that the speed is 60 miles per hour and the time is 3 hours, we can substitute these values into the formula as follows:

Distance = 60 x 3 = 180 miles

Therefore, the car covers a distance of 180 miles.

The answer is: 180 miles

Instruction: One gram of a certain health food contains 9 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. If vitamins E and A are to be obtained from no other source, how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins? options: A)8.5, B)10.5, C)12.5, D)14.5, E)16.5
Output: 

The health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. To obtain the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, the health food must contain a minimum of 100% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 100% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A.

To find the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E, we need to calculate the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E based on the percentage of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E that the health food contains.

Minimum daily requirement of vitamin E = 100% * 9% = 9 grams

To find the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A, we need to calculate the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A based on the percentage of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A that the health food contains.

Minimum daily requirement of vitamin A = 100% * 8% = 8 grams

Therefore, the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins is 9 grams.

The number is 2/3 of the original number.

To find the number, we need to find the value of 2/3 of the original number.

2/3 of the original number = 2/3 * x

The sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number = 40 + 1/3 * x

Therefore, we can write:

2/3 * x = 40 + 1/3 * x

2/3 * x - 40 = 1/3 * x

2/3 * x - 1/3 * x = 40

Instruction: The monthly salary S of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. What should the monthly sales be so that her monthly salary reaches $1500? options: A)$50000, B)$40000, C)$30000, D)$20000, E)None of these
Output: 

The monthly salary S of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. So, we need to find the monthly sales that will result in a salary of $1500.

We know that S = 500 + 0.05x, where x is the monthly sales.

Therefore, we need to find the value of x that makes S = $1500.

500 + 0.05x = 1500

0.05x = 1000

x = $20,000

The answer is: B

The monthly sales should be $20,000 to reach a salary of $1500.

Output: 

The points A,B,C,D,E and F form a regular pentagon. To form a quadrilateral, we need to choose 4 points from the 5 points.

The number of ways to choose 4 points from 5 points is given by the formula:

C(n,r) = n! / (n-r)!r!

where C(n,r) is the number of ways to choose r points from n points, n! is the factorial of n, and r! is the factorial of r.

Substituting the values of n and r into the formula, we get:

C(5,4) = 5! / (5-4)!4! = 5

Therefore, the number of different quadrilaterals that can be formed by joining 4 of the points A,B,C,D,E and F is 5.

Instruction: What will be the cost of gardening 1-metre – broad boundary around a rectangular plot having perimeter of 340 metres at the rate of 10 per square metre? options: A)3400, B)1700, C)3440, D)Cannot be determined, E)None of these
Output: 

The perimeter of a rectangular plot is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

Given the perimeter is 340 metres and the rate of gardening is 10 per square metre, we can find the length and width of the plot as follows:

P = 2(l + w)
340 = 2(l + w)
l + w = 170

Since the ratio of red to green sweets is 3:4, we know that the length of the plot is 3/4 of the perimeter. Therefore, the length of the plot is:

l = 3/4(170) = 135 metres

The cost of gardening 1-metre – broad boundary around a rectangular plot having perimeter of 340 metres at the rate of 10 per square metre is:

Instruction: Joe's age, Joe's sister's age and Joe’s fathers age sums up to 100. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Find the age of Joe's father? options: A)45, B)48, C)50, D)55, E)58
Output: 

**Step 1:**

Let's assume Joe's age is x, his sister's age is y and father's age is z.

**Step 2:**

We know that x + y + z = 100.

**Step 3:**

When Joe is as old as his father, x = z.

**Step 4:**

When Joe is as old as his father, y = 2z.

**Step 5:**

Substituting the value of x from step 2 into the equation from step 3, we get:

z = 100 - y

**Step 6:**

Substituting the value of y from step 4 into the equation from step 5, we get:

z = 2(2z) = 4z

**Step 7:**

Since z = 100, we can substitute this value into the equation from step 6 to get:

4z = 100

z = 25

**The answer is:** C

Therefore, the age of Joe's father is 25.

**Note:** The answer is 25.

**The answer is:** C

Instruction: If a subscription for 15 issues of a magazine costs $42.00 and represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices, what is the cover price per issue? options: A)$7.73, B)$6.73, C)$5.73, D)$4.73, E)$3.73
Output: 

The given information is:

- Subscription cost = $42.00
- Number of issues = 15
- Savings = 25%

We know that the cost of a subscription is directly proportional to the number of issues and the savings. Therefore, we can write:

Subscription cost = Number of issues × Cost per issue

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:

$42.00 = 15 × Cost per issue

Cost per issue = $42.00 / 15 = $2.40

Output: 

The area of a trapezium is given by the formula A = 1/2(b+h)(b-h), where A is the area, b is the length of the base, and h is the height.

Given the area of cross-section is 640 square meters and the width of the canal is 10 m, we can find the height of the trapezium by rearranging the formula as h = (A/b)^2 = (640/10)^2 = 64 square meters.

Therefore, the depth of the canal is 64 meters.

Output: 

The first step is to find out the number of marbles that were painted black. 20 marbles were painted black, so the remaining marbles are white.

The second step is to find out the number of marbles that were returned to the bag. 20 marbles were returned, so the total number of marbles in the bag is now 20 + 20 = 40 marbles.

Output: 

The length of the rectangular piece is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth. So, the length is 4 times the breadth plus 1m.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:

Perimeter = 2(length + breadth)

Substituting the values of length and breadth into the formula, we get:

Perimeter = 2(4(x+1) + x)

where x is the breadth of the rectangular piece.

Simplifying the equation will lead to:

Perimeter = 2(5x + 1)

Perimeter = 10x + 2

Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangular piece is 10x + 2.

Instruction: M = abc is a three digit number and N = cba, if M > N and M - N + 396c = 990. Then how many values of M are more than 300. options: A)20, B)30, C)40, D)200, E)None
Output: 

The given information is:

M = abc
N = cba
M - N + 396c = 990

We know that M > N and M - N + 396c = 990. So, we can find the values of M that are more than 300.

To find the values of M, we need to find the values of M that make M - N + 396c > 300.

To do this, we need to find the values of M that make M - N + 396c = 900.

To find the values of M, we need to isolate M on one side of the equation.

M - N + 396c = 900
M = 900 + N + 396c

Now, we need to find the values of M that make M - N + 396c > 300.

M - N + 396c > 300
M - N > 300

Substituting this into the equation above, we get:

900 + N + 396c > 300
900 + N > 300
N > 300 - 900
N > 600

Therefore, the values of M that are more than 300 are 600.

Instruction: Machine A puts out a yo-yo every 6 minutes. Machine B puts out a yo-yo every 9 minutes. After how many minutes will they have produced 10 yo-yos? options: A)24 minutes, B)32 minutes, C)36 minutes, D)64 minutes, E)72 minutes
Output: 

The question is asking how many minutes it will take for two machines to produce 10 yo-yos.

The first step is to find out how many yo-yos each machine will produce in one minute.

Machine A produces 1 yo-yo every 6 minutes, so it will produce 1/6 of a yo-yo in one minute.

Machine B produces 1 yo-yo every 9 minutes, so it will produce 1/9 of a yo-yo in one minute.

To produce 10 yo-yos, both machines will need to produce a total of 10/1 = 10 yo-yos.

The number of minutes it will take for both machines to produce 10 yo-yos is 10/1 = 10 minutes.

Instruction: A jeep travels a certain distance taking 6 hours in the forward journey. During the return journey, it increased its speed by 12km/hr and took 4 hours. What is the distance travelled by the jeep? options: A)126km, B)144km, C)127km, D)228km, E)128km
Output: 

The relative speed of the jeep is increased by 12km/hr, therefore the speed of the return journey is 52km/hr.

The time taken for the return journey is 4 hours.

The distance travelled by the jeep is equal to the distance travelled in the forward journey multiplied by the speed of the return journey.

Distance travelled = Distance travelled in the forward journey * Speed of return journey

Distance travelled = 6 hours * 52km/hr = 312km

Instruction: If 120 is reduced to 96, what is the reduction percent? options: A)30%, B)40%, C)20%, D)10%, E)5%
Output: 

The given information is:

* Original value (x) = 120
* Reduced value (y) = 96

We know that x = 120 and y = 96.

The formula for reduction percent is:

Reduction percent = (x - y) / x * 100%

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:

Reduction percent = (120 - 96) / 120 * 100%

Reduction percent = 24 / 120 * 100%

Reduction percent = 20%
