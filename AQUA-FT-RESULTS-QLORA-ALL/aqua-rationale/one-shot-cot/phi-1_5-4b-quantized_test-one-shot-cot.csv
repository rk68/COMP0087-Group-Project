Instruction: A paper is in a square form whose one side is 20 cm. Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters. If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper? options: A)8.75, B)8.79, C)8.75, D)8.71, E)8.72
Output: 
The area of the paper is given by the formula A = πr^2, where r is the radius of the semi circle.
The radius of the semi circle is half the diameter, so r = 20/2 = 10 cm.
The area of the semi circle is π(10)^2 = 100π cm^2.
The area of the remaining paper is the area of the square minus the area of the semi circle, which is A - 100π = πr^2 - 100π cm^2.
Therefore, the area of the remaining paper is πr^2 - 100π cm^2.

Instruction: All 250 files on Sam's hard drive are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm? options: A)50, B)70, C)75, D)100, E)125
Output: 

Solution:
Let's assume the number of files infected by a virus is V.
Since 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, the number of files infected by a virus is 0.5V.
Since the number of files infected by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm, the number of files infected by a worm is 2.5V.
The total number of files infected by a virus and a worm is V + 2.5V = 3.5V.
We know that the total number of files infected by a virus and a worm is 250, so we can write the equation:
3.5V = 250
Dividing both sides of the equation by 3.5, we get:
V = 71.43
Since the number of files infected by a virus cannot be a decimal, we round it to the nearest whole number.
Therefore, the number of files infected by a virus is 72.
The number of files infected by a worm is 2.5V = 2.5 * 72 = 180.
The total number of files infected by a virus and a worm is 72 + 180 =","Instruction: In an exam, a candidate secured 504 marks of the maximum mark of M.

Ball B makes 5 full rotation in 35 minutes. If they start rotating now from the same point, when will they be at the same starting point again? options: A)1 hour and 31 minutes, B)2 hour and 31 minutes, C)3 hour and 31 minutes, D)4 hour and 31 minutes, E)5 hour and 31 minutes
Output: If ball A makes 2 rotations in 26 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 13 minutes. If ball B makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 7 minutes.
The two balls start rotating now and makes several rotations before they are at the SAME starting points. Ball A would have done a WHOLE number X of rotations and ball B would have done a WHOLE number Y of rotations. Also they would have rotated during the same period of time T. Hence
T = 13 X = 7 Y
Hence 13 X = 7 Y
Solve the above for X
X = 7 Y / 13
We want the time when they are FIRST at the same starting point. Therefore X and Y are the smallest whole numbers of the equation X = 7 Y / 13. The smallest value of Y that gives X as a whole number is 13. Hence
X = 7 (13) / 13 = 7
Time T is given by
T = 13 X = 13 * 7 = 91 minutes = 1 hour and 31 minutes

Instruction: Two numbers are in the ratio 3:5. If 9 is subtracted from each, the new numbers are in the ratio 12:23. The smaller number is? options: A)21, B)33, C)35, D)42, E)58
Output: 

A) 21

Explanation: 

Let the smaller number be 3x and the larger number be 5x. 

Then, the new numbers are 12x and 23x. 

If 9 is subtracted from each, the new numbers are 12x - 9 and 23x - 9. 

We can see that 12x - 9 = 12x - 9 and 23x - 9 = 23x - 9. 

This means that the two numbers are in the ratio 3:5. 

Therefore, the smaller number is 3x. 

A) 21

Explanation: 

Let the smaller number be 3x and the larger number be 5x. 

Then, the new numbers are 12x and 23x. 

If 9 is subtracted from each, the new numbers are 12x - 9 and 23x - 9. 

We can see that 12x - 9 = 12x - 9 and 23x - 9 = 23x - 9.

Output: If ball A makes 2 rotations in 26 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 13 minutes. If ball B makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 7 minutes.
The two balls start rotating now and makes several rotations before they are at the SAME starting points. Ball A would have done a WHOLE number X of rotations and ball B would have done a WHOLE number Y of rotations. Also they would have rotated during the same period of time T. Hence
T = 13 X = 7 Y

We want the time when they are FIRST at the same starting point. Therefore X and Y are the smallest whole numbers of the equation X = 7 Y / 13. The smallest value of Y that gives X as a whole number is 13. Hence

A store sells two types of pens: ballpoint pens and gel pens. The store sold a total of 500 pens, with the ratio of ballpoint pens to gel pens being 3:2. If the store sold 120 ballpoint pens, how many gel pens did it sell?

Solution:

Let's assume the number of gel pens sold is x.

According to the given ratio, the number of ballpoint pens sold is 3/2 times the number of gel pens sold.

So, (3/2)x = 120

Multiplying both sides by 2/3, we get:

x = (120)(2/3)
x = 80

Therefore, the store sold 80 gel pens.

Answer: 80

Instruction: A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ? options: A)Rs 400, B)Rs 500, C)Rs 600, D)Rs 700, E)Rs 800
Output: 

Explanation:

Let's assume that each nephew receives x amount of Rs.

Then, each daughter receives 4x amount of Rs.

And each son receives 5x amount of Rs.

So, the total amount of Rs that the man divides is Rs(5x) + Rs(4x) + Rs(5x) = Rs(15x).

We know that the total amount of Rs is Rs(15x) = Rs(8600).

So, we can write the equation:

15x = Rs(8600)

Solving for x, we get:

x = Rs(8600)/15

x = Rs(480)

So, each nephew receives Rs(480) and each daughter receives Rs(480*4) = Rs(1920).

And each son receives Rs(480*5) = Rs(2400).

So, the total amount of Rs that each daughter receives is Rs(1920) and the total amount of Rs that each son receives is Rs(2400).

Therefore, the total amount of Rs that each daughter receives is Rs(1920) + Rs","Instruction: At an election meeting 10 speakers are to address the meeting.

Instruction: there are more than 501 students in a school such that 20% of them exactly took physics and 28% of them exactly took math. What could be the least possible no of students in the school? options: A)550, B)570, C)600, D)700, E)none of these
Output: 

Explanation:

Let the total number of students in the school be n.

Then, the number of students who took physics is 20% of n, which is 0.2n.

Similarly, the number of students who took math is 28% of n, which is 0.28n.

The total number of students who took either physics or math is the sum of the number of students who took physics and the number of students who took math, which is 0.2n + 0.28n = 0.48n.

Since the total number of students in the school is n, we can write the equation:

0.48n = n

Solving for n, we get:

n = n

This means that the total number of students in the school is unlimited.

Therefore, the least possible no of students in the school is unlimited.

How many students are there in the class? options: A)850, B)800, C)900, D)950, E)1000
Output: 
Let the total number of students be x.

The number of students interested in Cricket = 4/5 of x = 0.8x
The number of students interested in Basketball = 10% of x = 0.1x
The number of students not interested in any game = 20
Total number of students = x
0.08x + 0.8x + 0.1x + 20 = x
0.18x + 20 = x
0.18x - x = -20

Instruction: Allen starts from X, goes to Y. At the same time Bob starts from Y and goes towards X. Once Allen reaches Y he changes his direction and returns to X. Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y. options: A)144km, B)72 km, C)126km, D)84 km, E)48km
Output: 

Let's assume that Allen travels at a speed of 54 kmph and Bob travels at a speed of 78 kmph.

Let's assume that Allen travels for t1 hours and Bob travels for t2 hours.

Distance covered by Allen = 54t1 km
Distance covered by Bob = 78t2 km

According to the problem, Allen and Bob meet after t1 + t2 hours.

Therefore, 54t1 + 78t2 = t1 + t2

We know that the total distance covered by Allen and Bob is equal to the distance between X and Y.

Therefore, 54t1 + 78t2 = X + Y

We also know that Bob covers 48 km more than Allen.

Therefore, 78t2 = 54t1 + 48

Solving the above two equations, we get:

t1 = 2 hours
t2 = 1.5 hours

Therefore, the distance between X and Y is:

54t1 + 78t2 = X + Y
54(2) + 78(1.5) = X + Y
108 + 117 = X + Y

Question 2:

A group of friends went to a restaurant and ordered a pizza. The pizza was cut into 8 slices. If each person ate 2 slices, how many people were in the group?

Solution:

Let's assume the number of people in the group is x.

Since each person ate 2 slices, the total number of slices eaten is 2x.

According to the problem, the total number of slices is 8.

Therefore, we can write the equation:

2x = 8

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 8/2

x = 4

So, there were 4 people in the group.

Question 3:

A rectangular garden has a length of 12 meters and a width of 8 meters. What is the area of the garden?

Solution:

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = length * width.

Substituting the given values, we have:

Area = 12 * 8

Area = 96

So, the area of the garden is 96 square meters.

Instruction: John likes to have lightly flavored tea every evening. In a 50% strong milk tea, he replaces 15% of it with milk twice. Then, he replaces 10 percent of the resultant solution with more milk.
What is the final concentration of tea John drinks? options: A)15.38%, B)42%, C)39.86%, D)22.35%, E)32.51%
Output: 
Let the concentration of milk be M. Then the concentration of tea is 100% - 15% - 10% = 65%.
So the final concentration of tea is 65% of M.
65% of M = 0.65M
0.65M = 65% of M
0.65M = 65
M = 65/0.65
M = 100
