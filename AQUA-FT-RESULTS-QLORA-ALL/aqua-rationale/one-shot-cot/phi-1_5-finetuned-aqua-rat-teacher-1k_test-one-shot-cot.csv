ANSWER:E Answer: E

Instruction: You can purchase one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents, or two sodas and three energy bars for 300
cents. If the costs of the items do not change, compute the cost in cents of six sodas and seven bars. options: A)500, B)600, C)750, D)800, E)900
Output: 

If the cost of one soda is x cents, then the cost of six sodas is 6x cents.

If the cost of one energy bar is y cents, then the cost of seven energy bars is 7y cents.

Therefore, the total cost of six sodas and seven energy bars is 6x + 7y cents.

Since the total cost is equal to 150 cents, we can write:

6x + 7y = 150

To find the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars, we need to solve for x and y.

We can solve for x by rearranging the above equation:

6x = 150 - 7y

x = (150 - 7y)/6

Now that we know the cost of one soda is (150 - 7y)/6 cents, we can substitute this value into the equation for the total cost:

6x + 7y = 150

6x + 7(150 - 7y) = 150

6x + 1050 - 7y = 150

6x + 7y = 600

x = 200

Therefore, the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars is 200 cents.

Output: Jack did 2/3 of the work, which is 8 hours. So if Jack would finish the job this would take him 4 extra hours. Jill's rate is 5% of what Jack would do in those 4 hours. That means it would take her ten times as much time as Jack put into the job. 5*4 equals 20, answer E. Answer: E

Instruction: A sales person gets a 10% commission on each sale he makes. How many sales of $250 each must he make in order to reach a salary of at least $1000? options: A)15, B)24, C)25, D)40, E)52
Output: 

The sales person gets a 10% commission on each sale, which means that for each sale, he earns 10% of the sale price. To reach a salary of at least $1000, he must make enough sales to earn a total of $1000.

To find out how many sales of $250 each he must make, we need to divide $1000 by 10% (or 0.1) to find out how many sales he needs to make to earn $1000.

$1000 / 0.1 = $10,000

Therefore, the sales person must make at least $10,000 in sales to reach a salary of at least $1000.

Output: 

The original retail price is 60% more than the wholesale cost. So, the wholesale cost is 100% - 60% = 40% of the original retail price.

If the appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price, then the selling price is 100% - 20% = 80% of the original retail price.

Ball B makes 5 full rotation in 35 minutes.

Output: If ball A makes 2 rotations in 26 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 13 minutes. If ball B makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 7 minutes.
The two balls start rotating now and makes several rotations before they are at the SAME starting points. Ball A would have done a WHOLE number X of rotations and ball B would have done a WHOLE number Y of rotations. Also they would have rotated during the same period of time T. Hence
T = 13 X = 7 Y
Hence 13 X = 7 Y
Solve the above for X
X = 7 Y / 13
We want the time when they are FIRST at the same starting point. Therefore X and Y are the smallest whole numbers of the equation X = 7 Y / 13. The smallest value of Y that gives X as a whole number is 13. Hence
X = 7 (13) / 13 = 7
Time T is given by
T = 13 X = 13 * 7 = 91 minutes = 1 hour and 31 minutes

Output: 

Given information:
The ratio of two numbers is 3:5. If 9 is subtracted from each number, the new numbers are in the ratio 12:23.

We know that the ratio of two numbers is 3:5. So, if we subtract 9 from each number, the new numbers will be 3x and 5x respectively.

Therefore, 3x = 12 and 5x = 23.

Solving for x, we get
x = 12/3 = 4 and x = 23/5 = 4.4

The smaller number is 4.4.

Output: If ball A makes 2 rotations in 26 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 13 minutes. If ball B makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 7 minutes.
The two balls start rotating now and makes several rotations before they are at the SAME starting points. Ball A would have done a WHOLE number X of rotations and ball B would have done a WHOLE number Y of rotations. Also they would have rotated during the same period of time T. Hence

Instruction: A wire in the shape of rectangle of length 27 cm and breadth 17 cm is rebent to form a square. What will be the measure of each side? options: A)9, B)11, C)22, D)25, E)31
Output: 

The formula for the area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = l * b, where A is the area, l is the length, and b is the breadth.

Given that the length of the rectangle is 27 cm and the breadth is 17 cm, we can substitute these values into the formula to find the area.

A = 27 * 17 = 441 cm^2

Since the wire is rebent to form a square, the area of the square will be equal to the area of the rectangle. Therefore, we need to find the side length of the square that has the same area as the rectangle.

To find the side length, we need to find the square root of the area.

√441 = 21 cm

Instruction: A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ? options: A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280
Output: 

The company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost of $110 per unit, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. Therefore, the total cost of production is 420 x $110 = $46,200.

The revenue from sales is 420 x $1 = $420 per unit.

The profit per unit is $420 - $110 = $290.

To achieve a yearly profit of at least $626,400, the profit per unit must be greater than $290.

The minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a profit of at least $626,400 is $260.

Instruction: A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point. options: A)238, B)289, C)200, D)287, E)187
Output: 

The speed of the ship is x miles per hour. The speed of the plane is 10x miles per hour. They meet when they have traveled a total distance of 180 miles.

The distance traveled by the ship is equal to its speed multiplied by the time traveled. The distance traveled by the plane is equal to its speed multiplied by the time traveled.

Therefore, we can write the equation:

x * t = 180

10x * t = 180

t = 180/10x

The distance traveled by the plane is equal to 10 times the speed of the ship multiplied by the time traveled.

The distance traveled by the ship is equal to its speed multiplied by the time traveled.

Therefore, we can write the equation:

x * t = 180

x * t = 180/10x

t = 180/10x

The distance traveled by the plane is equal to 10 times the speed of the ship multiplied by the time traveled.

The distance traveled by the ship is equal to its speed multiplied by the time traveled.

Therefore, we can write the equation:

x * t = 180

x * t = 180/10x

t = 180/10x

The distance traveled by the plane is equal to 10 times the speed of the ship multiplied by the time traveled.

The distance traveled by the ship is equal to its speed","Instruction: A father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan who are 23 and 24 at present.

Instruction: Ram and Krishna start from A and B, respectively, at the same time and travel towards each other at constant speeds of 20m/s and 40m/s, respectively, along the same route. Ram meets Krishna at point C on the road after 10 seconds. Find the total distance between A to B. options: A)700 meters, B)1000 meters, C)700 kilometers, D)555 meters, E)600 meters
Output: 

The speed of Ram is 20m/s and Krishna's speed is 40m/s. So, the relative speed of their movement is 20 + 40 = 60m/s.

The time taken by Ram to cover the distance of 700 meters is 700/60 = 11.66 seconds.

The time taken by Krishna to cover the distance of 1000 meters is 1000/40 = 25 seconds.

Therefore, the total time taken by Ram and Krishna to cover the distance of 700 meters is 11.66 + 25 = 36.66 seconds.

The total distance covered by Ram and Krishna is 700 + 1000 = 1700 meters.

The total distance covered by both is 1700 meters.

Output: 

The height of the tree is directly proportional to the height of the pole and inversely proportional to the length of the shadow.

Given that the height of the pole is 14 metres and the height of the shadow is 10 metres, we can write:

h = k*l

where h is the height of the tree, k is the constant of proportionality, and l is the length of the shadow.

Substituting the values of h and l into the equation, we get:

14 = k*10

k = 14/10 = 1.4

Now that we know the value of k, we can use it to find the height of the tree:

h = 1.4*15 = 21 metres

Instruction: One gram of a certain health food contains 9 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. If vitamins E and A are to be obtained from no other source, how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins? options: A)8.5, B)10.5, C)12.5, D)14.5, E)16.5
Output: 

The health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. To obtain the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, the person must eat enough of the health food to provide at least 18% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 18% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A.

To find out how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least 18% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 18% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A, we need to calculate the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and vitamin A separately.

The minimum daily requirement of vitamin E is 18% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E. Therefore, to obtain 18% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E, the person must eat 18% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E.

The minimum daily requirement of vitamin A is 18% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. Therefore, to obtain 18% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A, the person must eat 18% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A.

To find out how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least 18% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 18% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A, we need to divide the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and vitamin A by the percentage of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E","Instruction: A newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week.

Instruction: Consider there is an staircase elevator and you are coming down. If you walk 20 steps and stop, then you reach bottom in 10 minutes. If you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach to the ground in 20 minutes. What is the speed of the elevator? options: A)1 step/minute, B)2 step/minute, C)3 step/minute, D)4 step/minute, E)None of the above
Output: 

The elevator is moving downwards, so it is important to know the speed of the elevator. We know that the time taken to reach the bottom is 10 minutes and the number of steps taken is 20. Therefore, the speed of the elevator can be calculated as:

Speed = Distance/Time

Since the elevator is moving downwards, the distance covered is the same as the number of steps taken. Therefore, the speed of the elevator is:

Speed = 20 steps/10 minutes = 2 steps/minute

Instruction: Allen starts from X, goes to Y. At the same time Bob starts from Y and goes towards X. Once Allen reaches Y he changes his direction and returns to X. Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y. options: A)144km, B)72 km, C)126km, D)84 km, E)48km
Output: 

Given information:
- Allen's speed = 54 kmph
- Bob's speed = 78 kmph
- Time taken = 1 hour

We know that distance covered by Allen = Speed x Time
Distance covered by Bob = Speed x Time

Since both Allen and Bob cover the same distance, we can equate the two distances:
54x = 78x

Subtracting 78x from both sides, we get:
-54x = -26x

Multiplying both sides by -1, we get:
54x = 26x

Subtracting 26x from both sides, we get:
-20x = 0

Therefore, the distance covered by Allen is 0 miles.

Output: 

John can make 3-letter codes with 5 vowels and 20 consonants. The middle letter must be vowel and the first letter and the third letter must be different from each other and are both consonant.

To find the number of different codes, we need to choose 5 vowels from 20 consonants and arrange them in a way that the middle letter is vowel and the first and third letters are different from each other.

There are a total of 20C5 ways to choose 5 vowels from 20 consonants.

Once we have chosen the vowels, we need to arrange them in a way that the middle letter is vowel and the first and third letters are different from each other.

There are a total of 20C5 ways to arrange 5 vowels in a way that the middle letter is vowel and the first and third letters are different from each other.

Therefore, the total number of different codes that John can make is 20C5 * 20C5 * 20C5 * 20C5 * 20C5 = 20^5 * 20^5 * 20^5 * 20^5 * 20^5 = 1,980,000

Output: 
The ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which will fit inside the cube is given by the formula V_cube/V_sphere = (V_sphere/V_sphere)^(1/3).

Given that the volume of the cube is V_cube and the volume of the sphere is V_sphere, we can substitute these values into the formula as follows:

V_cube/V_sphere = (V_sphere/V_sphere)^(1/3)

V_cube/V_sphere = (V_sphere/V_sphere)^(1/3)

V_cube/V_sphere = (V_sphere/V_sphere)^(1/3)

V_cube/V_sphere = (V_sphere/V_sphere)^(1/3)

Instruction: What will be the cost of gardening 1-metre – broad boundary around a rectangular plot having perimeter of 340 metres at the rate of 10 per square metre? options: A)3400, B)1700, C)3440, D)Cannot be determined, E)None of these
Output: 

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula 2(length + width).

Given the perimeter is 340 metres and the rate of gardening is 10 per square metre, we can find the area of the garden by dividing the perimeter by the rate of gardening.

Area = Perimeter/Rate

Instruction: A point on the edge of a fan blade that is rotating in a plane 10 centimeters from the center of the fan. What is the distance traveled, in centimeters, by this point after 30 seconds when the fan runs at the rate of 300 revolutions per minutes? options: A)750pi, B)1500pi, C)1875pi, D)3000pi, E)7500pi
Output: 

The distance traveled by a point on the edge of a fan blade that is rotating in a plane is directly proportional to the rate of rotation of the fan blade.

Given that the fan runs at the rate of 300 revolutions per minute, the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade in 30 seconds will be 300 revolutions per minute multiplied by 30 seconds, which is 9000 revolutions.

The distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade is 750pi centimeters.

Instruction: Joe's age, Joe's sister's age and Joe’s fathers age sums up to 100. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Find the age of Joe's father? options: A)45, B)48, C)50, D)55, E)58
Output: 

Let's call Joe's father's age as x.

According to the question,

Joe's age + Joe's sister's age + Joe's father's age = 100

x + y + z = 100

y = 2z

When Joe is as old as his father,

x = y

When Joe is as old as his father,

z = x

∴ Equation:

x = 2z

x = 2(y)

x = 2(2z)

x = 4z

Therefore, the age of Joe's father is 4z.

Output: 

The area of a trapezium is given by the formula A = 1/2(h)(b1 + b2), where A is the area, h is the height, and b1 and b2 are the bases.

Given that the area of cross-section is 640 square meters, and the width of the canal is 10 m at the top and 6 m at the bottom, we can find the height of the trapezium as follows:

A = 1/2(h)(b1 + b2)
640 = 1/2(h)(10 + 6)
h = 16

Therefore, the depth of the canal is 16 meters.

Output: 

Given information:

- Income (I) = x
- Percentage spent (P) = 70%
- Income increase (I') = 20%

Formula for new expenditure (E) = I' * P

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:

E = 0.2 * x * 70%

Expanding the brackets, we get:

E = 0.14x * 70%

Multiplying 0.14x by 70%, we get:

E = 0.98x

Instruction: A rectangular piece of 150 sq m has a length which is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth. What is the perimeter of the piece? options: A)60 m, B)61 m, C)62 m, D)63 m, E)64 m
Output: 

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = l*b, where A is the area, l is the length, and b is the breadth.

Given that the area is 150 sq m, and the length is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth, we can write l = 4b + 1.

Substituting this value of l into the formula for area, we get A = (4b + 1) * b = 4b^2 + b.

Since the area is 150 sq m, we can write 4b^2 + b = 150.

Solving for b, we get b = sqrt(150/4) = 15m.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2l + 2b, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and b is the breadth.

Substituting the values of l and b into the formula for perimeter, we get P = 2(4b + 1) + 2b = 2(4b + 1) + 2(15m) = 60m + 60m = 120m.

Therefore, the answer is B: 61 m.

Output: 

The given information is:

M = abc and N = cba

We know that M > N and M - N + 396c = 990.

To find the values of M that are more than 300, we need to find the values of M that satisfy the above equation.

First, we need to find the value of M that satisfies the equation M - N + 396c = 990.

M - N + 396c = 990

M = 990 + 396c

Now, we need to find the values of M that are more than 300.

M > 300

The values of M that are more than 300 are:

M = 990 + 396c, M = 900 + 396c, M = 1000 + 396c, M = 1200 + 396c, M = 1400 + 396c, M = 1600 + 396c, M = 1800 + 396c, M = 1900 + 396c, M = 2000 + 396c, M = 2100 + 396c, M = 2200 + 396c, M = 2400 + 396c, M = 2600 + 396c, M = 2800 + 396c, M = 3000 + 396c, M = 3100 + 396c, M = 3300 + 396c, M = 3600 + 396c, M = 3800 + 396c, M = 4000 + 396c, M = 4200","Instruction: While selling a watch, a shopkeeper gives a discount of 5%.

Output: 

The question is asking how many minutes it will take for Machine A and Machine B to produce 10 yo-yos.

Machine A puts out a yo-yo every 6 minutes, so it will take A x 6 minutes to produce 10 yo-yos.

Machine B puts out a yo-yo every 9 minutes, so it will take B x 9 minutes to produce 10 yo-yos.

Therefore, the total number of minutes it will take for Machine A and Machine B to produce 10 yo-yos is A x 6 + B x 9 = 6 + 9 = 15 minutes.
