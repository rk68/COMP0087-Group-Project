Output: 

The formula for distance travelled is given by the formula:

$$S = V*T$$

where S is the distance travelled, V is the speed, and T is the time taken.

Given the information, we know that S = V*T and T = 6 hours for the forward journey and T = 4 hours for the return journey.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

$$S = V*4$$

Since the speed increased by 12km/hr, the new speed is V + 12km/hr.

Substituting this value into the formula, we get:

$$S = V*4 + 12"
