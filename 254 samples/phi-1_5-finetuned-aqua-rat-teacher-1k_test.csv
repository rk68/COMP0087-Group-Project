ANSWER:E Answer: E

Instruction: You can purchase one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents, or two sodas and three energy bars for 300
cents. If the costs of the items do not change, compute the cost in cents of six sodas and seven bars. options: A)500, B)600, C)750, D)800, E)900
Output: 

If the cost of one soda is x cents, then the cost of six sodas is 6x cents.

If the cost of one energy bar is y cents, then the cost of seven energy bars is 7y cents.

Therefore, the total cost of six sodas and seven energy bars is 6x + 7y cents.

Since the total cost is equal to 150 cents, we can write:

6x + 7y = 150

To find the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars, we need to solve for x and y.

We can solve for x by rearranging the above equation:

6x = 150 - 7y

x = (150 - 7y)/6

Now that we know the cost of one soda is (150 - 7y)/6 cents, we can substitute this value into the equation for the total cost:

6x + 7y = 150

6x + 7(150 - 7y) = 150

6x + 1050 - 7y = 150

6x + 7y = 600

x = 200

Therefore, the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars is 200 cents.

Output: Jack did 2/3 of the work, which is 8 hours. So if Jack would finish the job this would take him 4 extra hours. Jill's rate is 5% of what Jack would do in those 4 hours. That means it would take her ten times as much time as Jack put into the job. 5*4 equals 20, answer E. Answer: E

Instruction: A sales person gets a 10% commission on each sale he makes. How many sales of $250 each must he make in order to reach a salary of at least $1000? options: A)15, B)24, C)25, D)40, E)52
Output: 

The sales person gets a 10% commission on each sale, which means that for each sale, he earns 10% of the sale price. To reach a salary of at least $1000, he must make enough sales to earn a total of $1000.

To find out how many sales of $250 each he must make, we need to divide $1000 by 10% (or 0.1) to find out how many sales he needs to make to earn $1000.

$1000 / 0.1 = $10,000

Therefore, the sales person must make at least $10,000 in sales to reach a salary of at least $1000.

Output: 

The original retail price is 60% more than the wholesale cost. So, the wholesale cost is 100% - 60% = 40% of the original retail price.

If the appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price, then the selling price is 100% - 20% = 80% of the original retail price.

Ball B makes 5 full rotation in 35 minutes.

Output: If ball A makes 2 rotations in 26 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 13 minutes. If ball B makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 7 minutes.
The two balls start rotating now and makes several rotations before they are at the SAME starting points. Ball A would have done a WHOLE number X of rotations and ball B would have done a WHOLE number Y of rotations. Also they would have rotated during the same period of time T. Hence
T = 13 X = 7 Y
Hence 13 X = 7 Y
Solve the above for X
X = 7 Y / 13
We want the time when they are FIRST at the same starting point. Therefore X and Y are the smallest whole numbers of the equation X = 7 Y / 13. The smallest value of Y that gives X as a whole number is 13. Hence
X = 7 (13) / 13 = 7
Time T is given by
T = 13 X = 13 * 7 = 91 minutes = 1 hour and 31 minutes

Output: 

Given information:
The ratio of two numbers is 3:5. If 9 is subtracted from each number, the new numbers are in the ratio 12:23.

We know that the ratio of two numbers is 3:5. So, if we subtract 9 from each number, the new numbers will be 3x and 5x respectively.

Therefore, 3x = 12 and 5x = 23.

Solving for x, we get
x = 12/3 = 4 and x = 23/5 = 4.4

The smaller number is 4.4.

Output: If ball A makes 2 rotations in 26 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 13 minutes. If ball B makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 7 minutes.
The two balls start rotating now and makes several rotations before they are at the SAME starting points. Ball A would have done a WHOLE number X of rotations and ball B would have done a WHOLE number Y of rotations. Also they would have rotated during the same period of time T. Hence

Instruction: A wire in the shape of rectangle of length 27 cm and breadth 17 cm is rebent to form a square. What will be the measure of each side? options: A)9, B)11, C)22, D)25, E)31
Output: 

The formula for the area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = l * b, where A is the area, l is the length, and b is the breadth.

Given that the length of the rectangle is 27 cm and the breadth is 17 cm, we can substitute these values into the formula to find the area.

A = 27 * 17 = 441 cm^2

Since the wire is rebent to form a square, the area of the square will be equal to the area of the rectangle. Therefore, we need to find the side length of the square that has the same area as the rectangle.

To find the side length, we need to find the square root of the area.

√441 = 21 cm

Instruction: A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ? options: A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280
Output: 

The company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost of $110 per unit, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. Therefore, the total cost of production is 420 x $110 = $46,200.

The revenue from sales is 420 x $1 = $420 per unit.

The profit per unit is $420 - $110 = $290.

To achieve a yearly profit of at least $626,400, the profit per unit must be greater than $290.

The minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a profit of at least $626,400 is $260.

Instruction: A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point. options: A)238, B)289, C)200, D)287, E)187
Output: 

The speed of the ship is x miles per hour. The speed of the plane is 10x miles per hour. They meet when they have traveled a total distance of 180 miles.

The distance traveled by the ship is equal to its speed multiplied by the time traveled. The distance traveled by the plane is equal to its speed multiplied by the time traveled.

Therefore, we can write the equation:

x * t = 180

10x * t = 180

t = 180/10x

The distance traveled by the plane is equal to 10 times the speed of the ship multiplied by the time traveled.

The distance traveled by the ship is equal to its speed multiplied by the time traveled.

Therefore, we can write the equation:

x * t = 180

x * t = 180/10x

t = 180/10x

The distance traveled by the plane is equal to 10 times the speed of the ship multiplied by the time traveled.

The distance traveled by the ship is equal to its speed multiplied by the time traveled.

Therefore, we can write the equation:

x * t = 180

x * t = 180/10x

t = 180/10x

The distance traveled by the plane is equal to 10 times the speed of the ship multiplied by the time traveled.

The distance traveled by the ship is equal to its speed","Instruction: A father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan who are 23 and 24 at present.

Instruction: Ram and Krishna start from A and B, respectively, at the same time and travel towards each other at constant speeds of 20m/s and 40m/s, respectively, along the same route. Ram meets Krishna at point C on the road after 10 seconds. Find the total distance between A to B. options: A)700 meters, B)1000 meters, C)700 kilometers, D)555 meters, E)600 meters
Output: 

The speed of Ram is 20m/s and Krishna's speed is 40m/s. So, the relative speed of their movement is 20 + 40 = 60m/s.

The time taken by Ram to cover the distance of 700 meters is 700/60 = 11.66 seconds.

The time taken by Krishna to cover the distance of 1000 meters is 1000/40 = 25 seconds.

Therefore, the total time taken by Ram and Krishna to cover the distance of 700 meters is 11.66 + 25 = 36.66 seconds.

The total distance covered by Ram and Krishna is 700 + 1000 = 1700 meters.

The total distance covered by both is 1700 meters.

Output: 

The height of the tree is directly proportional to the height of the pole and inversely proportional to the length of the shadow.

Given that the height of the pole is 14 metres and the height of the shadow is 10 metres, we can write:

h = k*l

where h is the height of the tree, k is the constant of proportionality, and l is the length of the shadow.

Substituting the values of h and l into the equation, we get:

14 = k*10

k = 14/10 = 1.4

Now that we know the value of k, we can use it to find the height of the tree:

h = 1.4*15 = 21 metres

Instruction: One gram of a certain health food contains 9 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. If vitamins E and A are to be obtained from no other source, how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins? options: A)8.5, B)10.5, C)12.5, D)14.5, E)16.5
Output: 

The health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. To obtain the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, the person must eat enough of the health food to provide at least 18% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 18% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A.

To find out how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least 18% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 18% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A, we need to calculate the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and vitamin A separately.

The minimum daily requirement of vitamin E is 18% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E. Therefore, to obtain 18% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E, the person must eat 18% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E.

The minimum daily requirement of vitamin A is 18% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. Therefore, to obtain 18% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A, the person must eat 18% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A.

To find out how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least 18% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 18% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A, we need to divide the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and vitamin A by the percentage of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E","Instruction: A newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week.

Instruction: Consider there is an staircase elevator and you are coming down. If you walk 20 steps and stop, then you reach bottom in 10 minutes. If you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach to the ground in 20 minutes. What is the speed of the elevator? options: A)1 step/minute, B)2 step/minute, C)3 step/minute, D)4 step/minute, E)None of the above
Output: 

The elevator is moving downwards, so it is important to know the speed of the elevator. We know that the time taken to reach the bottom is 10 minutes and the number of steps taken is 20. Therefore, the speed of the elevator can be calculated as:

Speed = Distance/Time

Since the elevator is moving downwards, the distance covered is the same as the number of steps taken. Therefore, the speed of the elevator is:

Speed = 20 steps/10 minutes = 2 steps/minute

Instruction: Allen starts from X, goes to Y. At the same time Bob starts from Y and goes towards X. Once Allen reaches Y he changes his direction and returns to X. Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y. options: A)144km, B)72 km, C)126km, D)84 km, E)48km
Output: 

Given information:
- Allen's speed = 54 kmph
- Bob's speed = 78 kmph
- Time taken = 1 hour

We know that distance covered by Allen = Speed x Time
Distance covered by Bob = Speed x Time

Since both Allen and Bob cover the same distance, we can equate the two distances:
54x = 78x

Subtracting 78x from both sides, we get:
-54x = -26x

Multiplying both sides by -1, we get:
54x = 26x

Subtracting 26x from both sides, we get:
-20x = 0

Therefore, the distance covered by Allen is 0 miles.

Output: 

John can make 3-letter codes with 5 vowels and 20 consonants. The middle letter must be vowel and the first letter and the third letter must be different from each other and are both consonant.

To find the number of different codes, we need to choose 5 vowels from 20 consonants and arrange them in a way that the middle letter is vowel and the first and third letters are different from each other.

There are a total of 20C5 ways to choose 5 vowels from 20 consonants.

Once we have chosen the vowels, we need to arrange them in a way that the middle letter is vowel and the first and third letters are different from each other.

There are a total of 20C5 ways to arrange 5 vowels in a way that the middle letter is vowel and the first and third letters are different from each other.

Therefore, the total number of different codes that John can make is 20C5 * 20C5 * 20C5 * 20C5 * 20C5 = 20^5 * 20^5 * 20^5 * 20^5 * 20^5 = 1,980,000

Output: 
The ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which will fit inside the cube is given by the formula V_cube/V_sphere = (V_sphere/V_sphere)^(1/3).

Given that the volume of the cube is V_cube and the volume of the sphere is V_sphere, we can substitute these values into the formula as follows:

V_cube/V_sphere = (V_sphere/V_sphere)^(1/3)

V_cube/V_sphere = (V_sphere/V_sphere)^(1/3)

V_cube/V_sphere = (V_sphere/V_sphere)^(1/3)

V_cube/V_sphere = (V_sphere/V_sphere)^(1/3)

Instruction: What will be the cost of gardening 1-metre – broad boundary around a rectangular plot having perimeter of 340 metres at the rate of 10 per square metre? options: A)3400, B)1700, C)3440, D)Cannot be determined, E)None of these
Output: 

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula 2(length + width).

Given the perimeter is 340 metres and the rate of gardening is 10 per square metre, we can find the area of the garden by dividing the perimeter by the rate of gardening.

Area = Perimeter/Rate

Instruction: A point on the edge of a fan blade that is rotating in a plane 10 centimeters from the center of the fan. What is the distance traveled, in centimeters, by this point after 30 seconds when the fan runs at the rate of 300 revolutions per minutes? options: A)750pi, B)1500pi, C)1875pi, D)3000pi, E)7500pi
Output: 

The distance traveled by a point on the edge of a fan blade that is rotating in a plane is directly proportional to the rate of rotation of the fan blade.

Given that the fan runs at the rate of 300 revolutions per minute, the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade in 30 seconds will be 300 revolutions per minute multiplied by 30 seconds, which is 9000 revolutions.

The distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade is 750pi centimeters.

Instruction: Joe's age, Joe's sister's age and Joe’s fathers age sums up to 100. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Find the age of Joe's father? options: A)45, B)48, C)50, D)55, E)58
Output: 

Let's call Joe's father's age as x.

According to the question,

Joe's age + Joe's sister's age + Joe's father's age = 100

x + y + z = 100

y = 2z

When Joe is as old as his father,

x = y

When Joe is as old as his father,

z = x

∴ Equation:

x = 2z

x = 2(y)

x = 2(2z)

x = 4z

Therefore, the age of Joe's father is 4z.

Output: 

The area of a trapezium is given by the formula A = 1/2(h)(b1 + b2), where A is the area, h is the height, and b1 and b2 are the bases.

Given that the area of cross-section is 640 square meters, and the width of the canal is 10 m at the top and 6 m at the bottom, we can find the height of the trapezium as follows:

A = 1/2(h)(b1 + b2)
640 = 1/2(h)(10 + 6)
h = 16

Therefore, the depth of the canal is 16 meters.

Output: 

Given information:

- Income (I) = x
- Percentage spent (P) = 70%
- Income increase (I') = 20%

Formula for new expenditure (E) = I' * P

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:

E = 0.2 * x * 70%

Expanding the brackets, we get:

E = 0.14x * 70%

Multiplying 0.14x by 70%, we get:

E = 0.98x

Instruction: A rectangular piece of 150 sq m has a length which is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth. What is the perimeter of the piece? options: A)60 m, B)61 m, C)62 m, D)63 m, E)64 m
Output: 

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = l*b, where A is the area, l is the length, and b is the breadth.

Given that the area is 150 sq m, and the length is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth, we can write l = 4b + 1.

Substituting this value of l into the formula for area, we get A = (4b + 1) * b = 4b^2 + b.

Since the area is 150 sq m, we can write 4b^2 + b = 150.

Solving for b, we get b = sqrt(150/4) = 15m.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2l + 2b, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and b is the breadth.

Substituting the values of l and b into the formula for perimeter, we get P = 2(4b + 1) + 2b = 2(4b + 1) + 2(15m) = 60m + 60m = 120m.

Therefore, the answer is B: 61 m.

Output: 

The given information is:

M = abc and N = cba

We know that M > N and M - N + 396c = 990.

To find the values of M that are more than 300, we need to find the values of M that satisfy the above equation.

First, we need to find the value of M that satisfies the equation M - N + 396c = 990.

M - N + 396c = 990

M = 990 + 396c

Now, we need to find the values of M that are more than 300.

M > 300

The values of M that are more than 300 are:

M = 990 + 396c, M = 900 + 396c, M = 1000 + 396c, M = 1200 + 396c, M = 1400 + 396c, M = 1600 + 396c, M = 1800 + 396c, M = 1900 + 396c, M = 2000 + 396c, M = 2100 + 396c, M = 2200 + 396c, M = 2400 + 396c, M = 2600 + 396c, M = 2800 + 396c, M = 3000 + 396c, M = 3100 + 396c, M = 3300 + 396c, M = 3600 + 396c, M = 3800 + 396c, M = 4000 + 396c, M = 4200","Instruction: While selling a watch, a shopkeeper gives a discount of 5%.

Output: 

Let's first find the sum of the digits of the original number:

Sum of digits = 1 + 8 + 6 = 15

Now, we know that the sum of the squares of the digits is 109. So, we can find the square of the first digit (1) as:

Square of first digit = 1^2 = 1

The sum of the squares of the remaining two digits is:

Sum of squares of remaining two digits = 8^2 + 6^2 = 64 + 36 = 100

Therefore, the total number of digits in the original number is 15.

Now, we can find the number by subtracting 495 from the original number:

Number = 15 + 100 - 495 = 568

Instruction: Tires of a certain brand, when purchased new, last for four years. A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year. The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires? options: A)8%, B)10%, C)12.5%, D)16.7%, E)25%
Output: 

The cost of repairing the current tires is $40 per tire, and the cost of purchasing the new tires is $180 per tire. Therefore, the average cost per year of the new tires is $180 - $40 = $140 per year.

The average cost per year of repairing the current tires is $40 per tire, and the average cost per year of purchasing the new tires is $140 per year. Therefore, the average cost per year of purchasing the new tires is $140 - $40 = $100 per year.

The average cost per year of repairing the current tires is $140 per year, and the average cost per year of purchasing the new tires is $100 per year. Therefore, the average cost per year of purchasing the new tires is $140 - $100 = $40 per year.

Instruction: The capacity of a tank of dimensions (8 m × 6 m × 2.5 m) is options: A)120 litres, B)1200 litres, C)12000 litres, D)120000 litres, E)None of these
Output: 

The capacity of a tank is given by the formula V = l × w × h, where V is the volume of the tank, l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.

Given the dimensions of the tank are 8 m × 6 m × 2.5 m, we can calculate the volume as follows:

V = 8 × 6 × 2.5 = 600 m³

The average speed is given by the formula V/T = V/T, where V is the volume of the tank and T is the time taken.

To find the average speed, we need to find the time taken for each speed.

For a speed of 5 kmph, the time taken will be 6 hours.

For a speed of 4 kmph, the time taken will be 12 hours.

Therefore, the average speed is:

Average speed = 6 hours + 12 hours = 18 hours

Population two years from now - 121;
Since the population two years from now (121) is exactly double the population one year ago then the population one year ago was 121/2=60.5.
Now, the question asks about the population increase over the last year, so from 60.5 (last year) to 100 (now): percent increase=difference/original*100=(100-60.5)/60.5*100=39.5/60.5*100=~2/3*100=~65%.

Instruction: A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower? options: A)5(√3 + 1), B)6(√3 + √2), C)7(√3 – 1), D)8(√3 – 2), E)None of these
Output: 

The car is traveling towards the base of a vertical tower at a uniform speed. The angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60° in 10 minutes. To find out how much more time it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower, we need to find the time it takes for the car to cover the distance to the base of the tower.

The distance to the base of the tower is equal to the length of the tower. Let's call this distance ""d"".

The speed of the car is equal to the distance traveled divided by the time taken. Let's call this speed ""s"".

The time taken to cover the distance to the base of the tower is equal to the distance traveled divided by the speed of the car. Let's call this time ""t"".

We know that the angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60° in 10 minutes. This means that the distance traveled by the car is equal to the height of the tower.

The height of the tower is equal to the length of the tower. So, we can write:

d = h

where ""h"" is the height of the tower.

We also know that the speed of the car is equal to the distance traveled divided by the time taken. So, we can write:

s = d/t

where ""s"" is the speed of the car, ""d"" is the distance","Instruction: What is 60% of 30% of 1400 grams? options: A)450 gms, B)100 gms, C)252 gms, D)240 gms, E)None of these

Therefore, after 2 years the population of the city will be 1.1025 * 78000 = 85995
ANSWER B Answer: B

Instruction: A certain liquid passes through a drain at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds. At that rate, how many minutes will it take y gallons to pass through the drain? options: A)y/(1200xy), B)20xy/w, C)5xy/(12w), D)w/(3xy), E)3y/(wx)
Output: 

The liquid passes through the drain at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds. At that rate, it will take y gallons to pass through the drain.

The formula for the time taken to pass through the drain is given by the equation:

t = y/w

where t is the time taken, y is the amount of liquid passed through the drain, and w is the rate of flow of the liquid.

If we substitute the values of w and y into this equation, we get:

t = y/(25x)

t = y/25x

To find the time taken to pass through the drain, we need to find the value of x that makes t equal to the time taken.

To do this, we need to find the value of x that makes t equal to the time taken. We can do this by taking the derivative of t with respect to x and setting it equal to 0:

d/dx t = y/25x = 0

x = 0

Therefore, the time taken to pass through the drain is 0 seconds.

Since both of them are eating simultaneously, how many minutes would it take them to empty the jar? options: A)4, B)5, C)6, D)7, E)8
Output: 

The question is asking for the number of minutes it would take two friends to empty a jar full of candies.

To solve this problem, we need to find the least number of minutes that satisfies the following conditions:

1. P can finish the candies in 10 minutes.
2. Q can finish half the jar in 5 minutes.

Since both P and Q are working together, they can finish the candies in 10 + 5 = 15 minutes.

Instruction: At the of his one-year investment, Charles received $54,080, including interest and principal from a certain investment. If the investment paid an annual interest of 8 percent compounded semi-annually, which of the following is the amount of money that Charles originally invested? options: A)$45,000, B)$50,000, C)$54,000, D)$59,000, E)$62,000
Output: 

The formula for compound interest is given by the formula A = Pe(r/n)n, where A is the future value, P is the principal, e is the base of the natural logarithm, r is the annual interest rate, and n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year.

Given that the future value (A) is $54,080, the annual interest rate (r) is 8%, and the number of times the interest is compounded per year (n) is 2, we can substitute these values into the formula to find the principal (P).

A = Pe(r/n)n
54,080 = Pe(0.08/2)2

To find the value of Pe, we need to rearrange the formula as follows:

Pe = 54,080 * (0.08/2)2

Pe = $18,000

Therefore, the original investment amount is $18,000.

Instruction: When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Find the area of the sheet. options: A)1584, B)1120, C)792, D)1320, E)1200
Output: 

When folded into two equal halves along one set of sides, the perimeter of the sheet is 48cm. So, the length of each part is 48cm/2 = 24cm.

When folded into two equal halves along the other set of sides, the perimeter of the sheet is 66cm. So, the length of each part is 66cm/2 = 33cm.

The area of a rectangular sheet is given by the formula A = l*w, where A is the area, l is the length, and w is the width.

For the first part, A = 24cm*24cm = 576cm2.

For the second part, A = 33cm*33cm = 1101cm2.

The answer","Instruction: Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool? options: A)8, B)15, C)12, D)6, E)3
Output: Since hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours, then in 2 + 3 = 5 hours it will fill 5/8th of the pool. Thus the remaining 3/8th is filled by hose B in 3 hours. This means that hose B,working alone, to fill the entire pool will need 3*8/3 = 8 hours.

Instruction: Car ‘X’ covers a distance of 320 kms in 8 hours and car ‘Y’ covers a distance of 415 kms in 5 hrs. What is the difference in the speed of the two cars? options: A)42kms/hr, B)41km/hr, C)43kms/hr, D)45kms/hr, E)None of these
Output: 

The formula for speed is given by the formula:

Speed = Distance/Time

where Distance is the distance covered and Time is the time taken.

For car ‘X’, the speed is 320/8 = 40 km/hr
For car ‘Y’, the speed is 415/5 = 83 km/hr

The difference in speed is 40-83 = -43 km/hr

Since the difference is negative, it means that car ‘Y’ is faster than car ‘X’.

Instruction: The difference between the squares of two numbers is 256000 and the sum of the numbers is 1000. The numbers are options: A)600, 400, B)628, 372, C)640, 360, D)None of these, E)Cannot be determined
Output: 

Let l and b be the two numbers.

We know that the difference between the squares of two numbers is 256000 and the sum of the numbers is 1000. So, we can write the following equation:

l^2 + b^2 = 256000

l + b = 1000

We also know that the sum of the numbers is 1000, so we can write the following equation:

l + b = 1000

Now, we can solve for l and b:

l = 1000 - b

l^2 + (1000 - b)^2 = 256000

(1000 - b)^2 = 256000 - l^2

(1000 - b)^2 = 256000 - l^2

(1000 - b)^2 = 256000 - l^2

(1000 - b)^2 = 256000 - l^2

(1000 - b)^2 = 256000 - l^2

(1000 - b)^2 = 256000 - l^2

(1000 - b)^2 = 256000 - l^2

(1000 - b)^2 = 256000 - l^2

(1000 - b)^2 = 256000 - l^2

(1000 - b)^2 = 256000 - l^2

(1000 - b)^2 = 256000","Instruction: What will be the cost of gardening 1-metre – broad boundary around a rectangular plot having perimeter of 340 metres at the rate of 10 per square metre? options: A)3400, B)1700, C)3440, D)Cannot be determined, E)None of these

Output: 

The given information is as follows:

- x and y are positive real numbers.
- [x] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x.
- L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y]
- R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y]

We know that [x] + [y] + [x + y] = x + y. Therefore, [x] + [y] = x + y.

Since [x] + [y] = x + y, we can conclude that [x] = x.

Now, we can see that [x] + [y] = x + y, therefore [x] + [y] = x.

Instruction: At Daifu university, 24% of all students are members of both a chess club and a swim team. If 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club, what percentage of all Daifu students are members of the swim team? options: A)20%, B)30%, C)40%, D)50%, E)60%
Output: 

There are a total of 100 students in Daifu university. 24% of all students are members of both a chess club and a swim team. So, the number of students who are members of the chess club and the swim team is 24% of 100 = 24 students.

If 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club, then the number of students who are members of the chess club but not members of the swim team is 20% of 24 = 4.8 students.

Since the number of students who are members of the chess club and the swim team must be a whole number, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the number of students who are members of the swim team but not members of the chess club is 4.

The total number of students who are members of the swim team but not members of the chess club is 4. So, the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team but not members of the chess club is 4/100 * 100% = 4%.

Output: 

Given information:
x < 0, y > 0, and |x^3| > |y^2|

We know that x < 0, so x must be negative.

y^2 > x^2, therefore y must be positive.

|x^3| > |y^2|, therefore x must be greater than y.

Since x is greater than y, the answer is A)x > y.

Output: Volume of Big Cube considering it is not hollow = L3 = 5*5*5 = 125 cm3
Size of hollow cube (considering 1 cm thickness on two faces of large cube = 5 - 2 = 3cm
Volume of hollow cube = 3*3*3 = 27 cm3
So Total Volume filled up by smaller cubes = Volume of Larger Cube - Volume of hollow cube

= 98 cm3
Volume of 1 small cube = 1*1*1 = 1 cm3
Total number of small cubes in the larger cube = 98 / 1 = 98
and Number of faces of 98 small cubes (6 faces each cube has) = 98*6 = 588 faces
Total Surface area of 6 faces of larger cube painted = 6*L2 = 6*5*5 = 150cm2
Surface area of one face of small cube = 1*1 = 1cm2
Number of faces of small cube painted = 150/1 = 150 faces
Hence number of faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted= 588-150

Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy. During a month, both of them makes 35 toys in total. If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob? options: A)15, B)16, C)17, D)18, E)19
Output: Lets say Alex has worked for x hrs., and Jacob has worked for y hrs. So, number of toys prepared by Alex is x/7, and Jacob is y/9. Since total number of toys prepared by both of them is 35.
=> x/7 + y/9 = 35.
=> 9x + 7y = (35)(63)
=> 7y = (35)(63) - 9x
=> y = (5)(63) - (9/7)x
=> y = 315 - (9/7)x
=> x is to be a multiple of 7. Also, we need to minimize the difference between x & y. Here are some possible values,
x = 126, y = 315 - (9/7)126 = 153
x = 133, y = 315 - (9/7)133 = 144
x = 140, y = 315 - (9/7)140 = 135
x = 147, y = 315 - (9/7)147 = 126
As we can see minimum difference between x and y is when x is 140 hrs. and y is 135 hrs. Thus total toys created by Jacob = y/9 = 135/9 = 15.

Instruction: A newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week. If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week and pays $210 per week for newspapers, how many newspapers does it buy on Monday? options: A)15, B)30, C)45, D)60, E)75
Output: 

The newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week. So, the total cost of newspapers for the rest of the days of the week is $1 x 6 = $6.

If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week, then it buys 2 x $4 = $8 on Sunday.

Therefore, the total cost of newspapers for the rest of the days of the week is $6 x 6 = $36.

The total cost of newspapers for the week is $8 + $36 = $44.

Since the hotel pays $210 per week for newspapers, it must have bought $210 / $44 = 4.5 newspapers on Monday.

Since we cannot buy a fraction of a newspaper, the answer is B.

Output: 

The bells ring at intervals of 36 seconds, 40 seconds and 48 seconds, respectively. They start ringing together at a particular time. When they will ring together again?

The time at which the bells will ring together again is the time at which the sum of the intervals between the two rings is equal to the time interval between the first two rings.

To find the time interval between the first two rings, we need to find the common multiple of 36, 40 and 48. The common multiple is 144 seconds.

The time interval between the first two rings is 144 seconds.

When the bells will ring together again, they will have completed 144 seconds of ringing.

Output: Volume of Big Cube considering it is not hollow = L3 = 5*5*5 = 125 cm3
Size of hollow cube (considering 1 cm thickness on two faces of large cube = 5 - 2 = 3cm
Volume of hollow cube = 3*3*3 = 27 cm3
So Total Volume filled up by smaller cubes = Volume of Larger Cube - Volume of hollow cube
= 125 - 27
= 98 cm3
Volume of 1 small cube = 1*1*1 = 1 cm3
Total number of small cubes in the larger cube = 98 / 1 = 98
and Number of faces of 98 small cubes (6 faces each cube has) = 98*6 = 588 faces
Total Surface area of 6 faces of larger cube painted = 6*L2 = 6*5*5 = 150cm2
Surface area of one face of small cube = 1*1 = 1cm2
Number of faces of small cube painted = 150/1 = 150 faces
Hence number of faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted= 588-150
= 438

Instruction: 10kg of a mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay. In order to make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand how much of the mixture is to be removed and replaced with pure sand? options: A)10/7, B)20/7, C)30/7, D)40/7, E)50/7
Output: 

The mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay. To make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand, we need to remove the same amount of sand as clay.

To do this, we need to find out the amount of sand and clay in the mixture.

The amount of sand in the mixture is 30% of 10kg = 3kg.

The amount of clay in the mixture is 70% of 10kg = 7kg.

Now that we know the amount of sand and clay in the mixture, we can remove the same amount of sand as clay.

Therefore, the amount of sand to be removed = 3kg

The amount of clay to be removed = 7kg

The answer","Instruction: A hollow cube of size 5cm is taken, with the thickness of 1cm. It is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm .If the outer surface of the cube is painted how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted? options: A)438, B)550, C)500, D)450, E)498
Output: Volume of Big Cube considering it is not hollow = L3 = 5*5*5 = 125 cm3
Size of hollow cube (considering 1 cm thickness on two faces of large cube = 5 - 2 = 3cm
Volume of hollow cube = 3*3*3 = 27 cm3
So Total Volume filled up by smaller cubes = Volume of Larger Cube - Volume of hollow cube
= 125 - 27
= 98 cm3
Volume of 1 small cube = 1*1*1 = 1 cm3
Total number of small cubes in the larger cube = 98 / 1 = 98
and Number of faces of 98 small cubes (6 faces each cube has) = 98*6 = 588 faces
Total Surface area of 6 faces of larger cube painted = 6*L2 = 6*5*5 = 150cm2
Surface area of one face of small cube = 1*1 = 1cm2
Number of faces of small cube painted = 150/1 = 150 faces
Hence number of faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted= 588-150
= 438

Instruction: Jerry purchased a 1-year $5,000 bond that paid an annual interest rate of 12% compounded every six months. How much interest had this bond accrued at maturity? options: A)$5102, B)$618, C)$216, D)$202, E)$200
Output: 

The formula for the compound interest is given by the formula A = Pe(r/n)n, where A is the future value, P is the principal, e is the base of the natural logarithm, r is the annual interest rate, and n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year.

Given the information, we can substitute the values into the formula as follows:

A = $5,000(1 + 0.12/6)6

A = $5,000(1 + 0.02)6

A = $5,000(1.02)6

A = $5,000(1.12)6

A = $6,000

The interest accrued at maturity is $6,000 - $5,000 = $1,000.

The","Instruction: The average wages of a worker during a fortnight comprising of 15 consecutive working days was $90 per day. During the first 7 days, his average wage was $87 per day and the average wage during the last 7 days was $92 per day. What was his wage on the 8th day? options: A)$83, B)$92, C)$90, D)$97, E)$104
Output: The total wage earned during the 15 days that the worker worked = 15 * 90 = $ 1350.
The total wage earned during the first 7 days = 7 * 87 = $ 609.
The total wage earned during the last 7 days = 7 * 92 = $ 644.
Total wage earned during the 15 days = wage during first 7 days + wage on 8th day + wage during the last 7 days.
Or 1350 = 609 + wage on 8th day + 644
Wage on 8th day = 1350 - 609 - 644 = $ 97.

Output: Explanation:
Suppose the merchant will take advantage of the cash discount of 4% of $20 000 = $800 by paying the bill within 30 days from the date of invoice. He needs to borrow $20 000 = $800 = $19 200. He would borrow this money on day 30 and repay it on day 100 (the day the original invoice is due) resulting in a 70-day loan. The interest he should be willing to pay on borrowed money should not exceed the cash discount $800.
r=I/pt=21.73%
The highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money is 21.73%. This is a break-even rate. If he can borrow money, say at a rate of 15%, he should do so. He would borrow $19 200 for 70 days at 15%. Maturity value of the loan is $19 200(1+0.15(70/365))=$19 752.33
savings would be $20 000 − $19 752.33 = $247.67

Instruction: In the coordinate plane, a triangle has vertices at (a,0), (b,0), and (x,y). If a>x>b>0>y, which of the following represents the area of that triangle? options: A)(ay−by)/2, B)(ab−ay)/2, C)(by−ay)/2, D)(ay+by)/x, E)(a−b)/2y
Output: 
The area of a triangle is given by the formula A = 1/2(a*b*h), where A is the area, a and b are the lengths of the two bases, and h is the height.

Given the information, we know that a>x>b>0>y, which means that a is greater than x, b is greater than 0, and y is greater than 0. Therefore, the triangle has a base of length x and a height of length y.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get A = 1/2(x*y*h).

Since h is equal to the height of the triangle, we can simplify the formula to A = 1/2(x*y).

Therefore, the area of the triangle is A = 1/2(x*y).

Instruction: A rectangular solid, 3 x 4 x 15, is inscribed in a sphere, so that all eight of its vertices are on the sphere. What is the diameter of the sphere? options: A) 13.3542, B) 15.8113, C) 18.3451, D) 19.5667, E) 20.8888
Output: 

The sphere is a perfect sphere, so its diameter is equal to the radius of the sphere. The radius of the sphere is equal to the length of the diagonal of the rectangular solid. The diagonal of a rectangular solid is given by the formula:

$$d = \sqrt{2l^2 + w^2 + h^2}$$

where d is the diagonal, l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.

Substituting the values of l, w, and h into the formula, we get:

$$d = \sqrt{2(3)^2 + 4(3)^2 + 15^2} = \sqrt{2(9) + 4(9) + 225 = \sqrt{2(18) + 4(18) + 225 = \sqrt{36 + 72 + 225 = \sqrt(360) = 6$$

Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is 6.

The train covers a quarter of the distance in 10 hours at a speed of 100 miles/hour. So, the distance covered is 100 miles/hour x 10 hours = 1000 miles.

The remaining distance is 750 miles.

The train slows down to a speed of 75 miles/hour, so the time taken to cover the remaining distance is 750 miles/75 miles/hour = 10 hours.

Therefore, the total journey duration is 10 hours + 10 hours = 20 hours.

Instruction: Christopher and Jonathan were having bets. They decide that a coin will be flipped twenty times and each time it turns heads, Christopher will give $2 to Jonathan and each time it turns out to be Tails, Jonathan will give 3$ to Christopher. After flipping for twenty times none of the both won or lost any amount.
How many times did the coin landed on Heads ? options: A)10, B)23, C)16, D)18, E)12
Output: 

The coin will land on heads approximately 16.66 times.

The total amount of money Christopher will give to Jonathan is $2 * 16.66 = $33.33.

The total amount of money Jonathan will give to Christopher is $3 * 16.66 = $50.00.

Therefore, the total amount of money exchanged between Christopher and Jonathan is $33.33 + $50.00 = $83.33.

The telephone bill is party fixed and partly varies as the number of calls consumed. When in a certain month 540 calls are made the bill is Rs.1800. In another month 620 calls are consumed then the bill becomes Rs.2040. In another month 500 units are consumed due to more holidays. The bill for that month would be:

**Step 1:** Calculate the ratio of calls consumed to the total calls made.

The ratio of calls consumed to the total calls made is 620/540 = 1.11.

**Step 2:** Multiply the ratio of calls consumed to the total calls made by the total number of calls made.

The total number of calls made is 540 + 620 + 500 = 1520 calls.

Instruction: A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth? options: A)56, B)58, C)60, D)62, E)64
Output: 

The area of a square is given by the formula A = s^2, where A is the area and s is the length of one side of the square.

If the area of each triangle is 70 square feet, then the length of one side of the original square piece is 70/2 = 35 feet.

The perimeter of a square is given by the formula P = 4s, where P is the perimeter and s is the length of one side of the square.

Therefore, the perimeter of the original square piece is 4(35) = 140 feet.

Instruction: A box contains a certain number of balls, marked successively from 1 to n. If there are 45 different ways that two balls can be selected from the box such that the ball with number 3 marked on it is not selected, then what is the value of n? options: A)11, B)10, C)9, D)8, E)7
Output: 

There are a total of n balls in the box, and there are a total of 45 ways to select two balls from the box.

If the ball with number 3 marked on it is not selected, then there are n - 1 balls left to select from.

The number of ways to select two balls from the remaining balls is n - 1 ways.

Therefore, the total number of ways to select two balls from the box is n - 1 ways.

Since there are 45 different ways to select two balls from the box, the number of ways to select two balls from the box that do not have the ball with number 3 marked on it is 45 - 1 = 44 ways.

The answer is: B) 10

I hope this is the answer you are looking for.

Since the question is about the number of balls in the box, the answer is B) 10.

This is because there are a total of n balls in the box, and there are a total of 45 ways to select two balls from the box. If the ball with number 3 marked on it is not selected, then there are n - 1 balls left to select from. The number of ways to select two balls from the remaining balls is n - 1 ways.

Output: 

The information provided states that at least 45% of the students attended the prom night and at least 35% took part in the debating session. Therefore, the remaining students must have attended the prom night but not taken part in the debating session.

To find the maximum number of students who could have attended the prom night but not taken part in the debating session, we need to find the number of students who attended the prom night but did not take part in the debating session.

45% of 200 students attended the prom night, which is 90 students. Therefore, the remaining students who attended the prom night but did not take part in the debating session are 200 - 90 = 110 students.

The maximum number of students who could have attended the prom night but not taken part in the debating session is 110 students.

The formula for the sum of two numbers is:

Sum = (a + b) / 2

where a and b are the numbers and 2 is the constant.

Substituting the values of a and b into the formula, we get:

300 = (272 - 32) / 2 + (124 + 176) / 2

300 = 248 / 2 + 300 / 2

300 = 128 + 300 / 2

Output: 

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = l * w, where A is the area, l is the length, and w is the width.

We know that the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, and the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet. So, the length of the painted sides must be 37 - 9 = 28 feet.

Therefore, the area of the painted sides is 28 * w = 28w square feet.

The area of the parking space is the same as the area of the painted sides, so A = 28w square feet.

Approximately, what percent of the original food was in the dog's bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon of the same day? options: A)20%, B)25%, C)30%, D)35%, E)40%
Output: 

At 8:00 am, Jim's dog ate 1/3 of the dog food remaining in the bowl. This means that 2/3 of the original food was still in the bowl.

At noon, the dog began to eat, so the remaining food in the bowl was 1/3 of the original food. This means that 2/3 of the original food was eaten.

Therefore, the total amount of food in the bowl at noon was 2/3 of the original food.

The original food was 1/3 of the food remaining in the bowl. So, the percentage of the original food that was in the bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon was 1/3 * 100% = 33.33%.

Instruction: John conducted a survey about car color. 60% of the people who took the survey were women. Of the men who were surveyed, 75% preferred red cars over green cars. If 10 men liked green cars more than red, how many people took the survey? options: A)100, B)120, C)50, D)200, E)80
Output: 

1. Calculate the number of women who took the survey. 60% of the total number of people who took the survey were women, so the number of women who took the survey is 0.6 * Total number of people who took the survey.

2. Calculate the number of men who liked red cars. 75% of the men who took the survey liked red cars, so the number of men who liked red cars is 0.75 * Total number of men who took the survey.

3. Calculate the number of men who liked green cars. 10 men liked green cars more than red cars, so the number of men who liked green cars is 10.

4. Calculate the number of people who took the survey. The number of people who took the survey is the total number of people who took the survey minus the number of women who took the survey plus the number of men who liked red cars.

5. Substitute the values of the number of women who took the survey, the number of men who liked red cars, and the number of men who liked green cars into the equation. Total number of people who took the survey = 0.6 * Total number of people who took the survey, Number of men who liked red cars = 0.75 * Total number of men who took the survey, Number of men who liked green cars = 10, Number of people who took the survey = 0.6 * Total number","Instruction: If the population of a city increases by 5 % annually, what will be the population of the city in 2 years time if its current population is 78000? options: A)81900, B)85995, C)85800, D)90000, E)None of these

Instruction: What is the largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation x2 - 5x + k = 0 will have two real and distinct roots? options: A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12
Output: 

The quadratic equation is given by the formula:

x2 - 5x + k = 0

To find the roots, we need to find the values of 'k' that make the equation equal to zero.

To do this, we can use the quadratic formula:

k = [x2 - 5x + 0] / 2

k = 0

Since 'k' is equal to 0, the equation has two distinct roots.

The largest integral value of 'k' for which the equation has two distinct roots is:

k = 0

The formula for simple interest is given by the formula I = P*R*T, where I is the interest, P is the principal, R is the rate of interest, and T is the time period.

Given values are:
P = Rs.360
R = Unknown
T = 12 months

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
I = 360*31.50*12

Instruction: Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. If the yard has an area of 240 square meters, how many meters of fencing does she need? options: A)58, B)62, C)66, D)70, E)74
Output: 

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = l * w, where A is the area, l is the length, and w is the width.

We know that the area of the yard is 240 square meters and that the side of the yard that is left unfenced has a length of 10 meters. So, the area of the side that is left unfenced is 10 * 10 = 100 square meters.

Therefore, the total area of the sides that need fencing is 240 - 100 = 140 square meters.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2l + 2w, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

To find the perimeter of the sides that need fencing, we need to multiply the length of the sides by 2 and then add 2 to that. So, the perimeter of the sides that need fencing is 2 * 140 + 2 * 10 = 280 + 20 = 300 meters.

Instruction: A merchant receives an invoice for a motor boat for $20 000 with terms 4/30, n/100. What is the highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money in order to take advantage of the discount? options: A)247.67, B)237.67, C)227.67, D)215.67, E)None of these
Output: 

The invoice is for a motor boat and the discount is 4/30. So, the remaining amount to be paid is $20,000 - $4,000 = $16,000.

The simple interest rate is given by the formula:

Simple Interest = Principal x Rate x Time

where Principal is the amount borrowed, Rate is the simple interest rate, and Time is the time period.

We know that Simple Interest = $16,000 x Rate x Time.

We also know that Simple Interest = $16,000 x Rate x Time.

Therefore, we can find the highest Rate that satisfies the above equation as:

Rate = $16,000 x Rate x Time / $16,000 x 4/30

Rate = $16,000 x Rate x Time / $16,000 x 4/30

Rate = $16,000 x Rate x Time / $16,000 x 4/30

Rate = $16,000 x Rate x Time / $16,000 x 4/30

Rate = $16,000 x Rate x Time / $16,000 x 4/30

Rate = $16,000 x Rate x Time / $16,000 x 4/30

Rate = $16,000 x Rate x Time / $16,000 x 4/30

Rate = $16,000 x Rate x Time / $16","Instruction: The nefarious bandit Hoopsmot decides to go in with his criminal partner Smolapon to purchase a number of senators.

Company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. It estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. What is the manufactured cost of each pen? options: A)Rs. 6, B)Rs. 7.2, C)Rs. 5.6, D)Rs. 8, E)None of these
Output: 

The company produces 7200 pens and 10% of them are defective, so the number of good pens is 7200 - 10% * 7200 = 6800 pens.

The cost of each good pen is Rs. 6, therefore the total cost of all the pens is 6800 * Rs. 6 = Rs. 46,800.

The profit on all the pens is 25%, therefore the profit on each pen is 25% * Rs. 46,800 = Rs. 11.5.

The cost of each pen is Rs. 6, therefore the cost of each pen is Rs. 11.5 / 6 = Rs. 1.42.

Instruction: If one of the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 + mx + 22 = 0 is 1.5, then what is the value of m? options: A)-23.5, B)-17.5, C)-10.5, D)-16.2, E)Cannot be determined
Output: 

The quadratic equation is given by the formula x^2 + mx + 22 = 0. We know that one of the roots of the equation is 1.5, so we can substitute this value into the formula to find the other root.

1.5x^2 + mx + 22 = 0
1.5x^2 + mx + 22 = 0
1.5x^2 + mx + 22 - 1.5x = 0
1.5x^2 + mx + 15 = 0

To find the value of m, we need to find the value of m that makes the equation true. We can do this by finding the value of m that makes the equation equal to zero.

m = 15

The answer is: A) 4 1/3 km/h

The average speed is given by the formula total distance/total time. We know that the total distance is 4 1/3 km and the total time is 6 hours. So, the average speed is 4 1/3 km/h.

Instruction: The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item? options: A)$61, B)$65, C)$67.40, D)$70, E)$78.20
Output: 

1. Calculate the discounted price of the item.
The discounted price is 22% of the original price, which is $20. So, the discounted price is $20 x 0.22 = $4.80.

2. Subtract the coupon from the discounted price.
The discounted price after the coupon is $20 - $4.80 = $15.20.

3. Calculate half the original price.
Half the original price is $15.20 / 2 = $7.60.

4. Add $1.90 to half the original price.
The final price after adding $1.90 is $7.60 + $1.90 = $9.50.

The original price of the item is $9.50.

Answer: A

The answer is: A) $61

The original price of the item is $61.

This answer is correct because the discounted price is $20, the coupon is $4.80, half the original price is $7.60, and $1.90 is added to $7.60. Therefore, the final price is $7.60 + $1.90 = $9.50.

Output: 

The train M travels at a speed of 60 km/hr and the train N travels at a speed of 80 km/hr. Therefore, the relative speed of the two trains is 20 km/hr.

The time taken by the train M to reach City B is 5 hours. Therefore, the distance covered by the train M is 60 x 5 = 300 km.

The time taken by the train N to reach City A is 10 hours. Therefore, the distance covered by the train N is 80 x 10 = 800 km.

The total distance covered by the two trains is 300 + 800 = 1100 km.

The cost of the sewing machine is Rs. 1200/-. So, the cost price of the sewing machine is Rs. 1200/100 = Rs. 12.

The selling price of the sewing machine is Rs. 1200/-20% = Rs. 960.

The profit made by selling the sewing machine is Rs. 960 - Rs. 1200 = Rs. -80.

Therefore, the price at which the Karan should mark the sewing machine to make a profit of 20% is Rs. 960 - 80 = Rs. 840.

How much time will it take Roy to consume all the 5 tablets? options: A)45 Min, B)75 Min, C)90 Min, D)120 Min, E)60 Min
Output: 

The question is about the time it will take Roy to consume all 5 tablets.

The doctor gave Roy 5 tablets and asked him to take one tablet every 15 minutes. So, the total number of tablets consumed by Roy will be 5.

To find out the time it will take Roy to consume all the 5 tablets, we need to divide the total number of tablets consumed by the number of tablets consumed per time interval.

The number of tablets consumed per time interval is 1.

Therefore, the time it will take Roy to consume all 5 tablets is 5.

Instruction: A father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan who are 23 and 24 at present. He divides the amount in such a way that if their shares are invested at compound interest at 4% p.a. they will receive equal amount on attaining the age of 26 years. Find Mohan's share. options: A)2400, B)2500, C)2600, D)2700, E)None of these
Output: 

The formula for compound interest is given by the formula A = Pe(r/n)n(t), where A is the future value, P is the principal, e is the base of the natural logarithm, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the number of years.

Given information:
P = Rs. 5100
r = 4% p.a.
n = 2
t = 26 years

We need to find the value of e that satisfies the equation A = Pe(r/n)n(t).

Substituting the values of P, r, n, and t into the formula, we get:

A = Pe(4/2)2(26)

A = Rs. 2600

Output: 

The length of a straight picket fence is equal to the number of pickets multiplied by the width of each picket, plus the space between each pair of pickets.

Given that there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, the total width of the fence is 1/2 inch + 6 inches = 1/2 inch + 6/12 inches = 1/2 inch + 1/6 inches = 1/2 inch + 1/6 inches = 1/2 inch + 1/6 inches = 1/2 inch + 1/6 inches = 1/2 inch

Instruction: IF one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink? options: A)0.5, B)1, C)1.25, D)1.5, E)2
Output: 

Given information:
- One gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water.
- The orange juice is 60% of the soft drink.

We know that the soft drink is 100% orange juice and water. So, to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink, we need to add more orange juice.

To find out how many additional gallons of orange juice are needed, we need to calculate the amount of orange juice that is added to the soft drink.

Let's assume that the amount of orange juice added to the soft drink is B gallons.

The total amount of orange juice in the soft drink is now 40% + B gallons.

To make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink, we need to have 60% of the total orange juice in the soft drink.

So, we can write the equation:

40% + B = 60% * 100%

B = 100% - 40%

B = 60%

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is: B) 1.25

Instruction: The number of water lilies on a certain lake doubles every two days. If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies. In how many days will the lake be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it? options: A)15, B)28, C)30, D)53, E)59
Output: 

The number of water lilies doubles every two days, so the number of water lilies on the lake will double every two days. Therefore, after the first two days, there will be 64 x 2 = 128 water lilies on the lake.

After the third day, there will be 128 x 2 = 256 water lilies on the lake.

After the fourth day, there will be 256 x 2 = 512 water lilies on the lake.

After the fifth day, there will be 512 x 2 = 1024 water lilies on the lake.

After the sixth day, there will be 1024 x 2 = 2048 water lilies on the lake.

After the seventh day, there will be 2048 x 2 = 4096 water lilies on the lake.

After the eighth day, there will be 4096 x 2 = 8192 water lilies on the lake.

After the ninth day, there will be 8192 x 2 = 16384 water lilies on the lake.

After the tenth day, there will be 16384 x 2 = 32768 water lilies on the lake.

Instruction: Last year, 34 percent of Ace Book Company's sales revenue came from the sale of novels. Of the remaining revenue, 1/3 was from the sale of biographies. The company's revenue from the sale of novels was approximately, how many times its revenue from the sale of biographies? options: A)1.3, B)1.5, C)2.1, D)2.5, E)3.1
Output: 

The company's revenue from the sale of novels was 34% of its revenue, which is equivalent to 34/100 * Total revenue. The remaining revenue was 1/3 of the total revenue, which is equivalent to 1/3 * Total revenue. Therefore, the revenue from the sale of biographies was 1/3 * Total revenue.

To find the number of times the revenue from the sale of biographies was equal to the revenue from the sale of novels, we need to find the ratio of the revenue from the sale of biographies to the revenue from the sale of novels.

The ratio of revenue from the sale of biographies to the revenue from the sale of novels is 1/3.
